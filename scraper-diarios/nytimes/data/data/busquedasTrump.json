Before heading inside, Clinton listened at length to the truckers, and eventually invited two of them to join the round table inside. \u201cThey are doing what Americans do,\u201d she ", " at the event. \u201cWhen you finally get pushed to the end of the rope, you have to stand up and say enough.\u201d", "\u201cHillary struck me as someone who was willing to actually listen,\u201d William Herr, one of the truckers, told me when I caught him on the phone driving through New Mexico on Wednesday. Clinton got Herr\u2019s vote in the primary. Another trucker who met her, Mark Kirsch, is a registered Republican but says that he would most likely have voted for Clinton over John McCain in the general election. \u201cShe seemed very down to earth,\u201d he says. \u201cShe seemed to relate to regular people.\u201d", "Both men are now inclined to vote for Donald J. Trump. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even understand what the working class is anymore,\u201d Kirsch says. \u201cTrump might be an unmitigated ass,\u201d Herr says. \u201cBut he\u2019s our unmitigated ass.\u201d", "So far, one of the most surprising aspects of the Democratic National Convention unfolding two hours east of Harrisburg this week is how little of it has been dedicated to shoring up Clinton\u2019s support with the white, working-class voters she aggressively courted in states like Pennsylvania eight years ago, the constituency she seems most likely to lose to Trump. The antigun, pro-abortion rights, immigrant-friendly and \u201cstronger together\u201d message in Philadelphia is no doubt intended to mollify both the Bernie Sanders loyalists and the minority groups that are expected to turn out heavily for Clinton in November. Watching the pageant unfold, it\u2019s easy to forget that Clinton, running against Barack Obama in 2008, unabashedly offered herself as the safe haven for white, blue-collar Democrats.", "Campaigning during the Pennsylvania primary, she bemoaned lousy trade deals \u2014 including the North American Free Trade Agreement, a signature accomplishment of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. She vowed to bring manufacturing jobs back to Pennsylvania. She trash-talked China. And she condemned Obama for his offhand clinging-to-their-guns-and-religion remark as well as for his fidelity to the controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright. Clinton knew what all of this would get her. In an ", " that spring, she pointed to data showing that \u201cSenator Obama\u2019s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states\u201d \u2014 meaning Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 \u201cwho had not completed college were supporting me.\u201d In the end, she beat Obama by nine points in the primary. And in so doing, she unintentionally provided a blueprint for how Trump may be able to beat her in November.", "Recent history suggests that Clinton has nothing to worry about in Pennsylvania, which a Republican presidential candidate has not won since 1988. That\u2019s been largely because the majority of the state\u2019s votes come from Philadelphia and the surrounding three suburban \u201ccollar counties,\u201d which are all heavily Democratic. (Obama carried the state in 2012 by 300,000 votes, almost entirely because of the 600,000-vote edge he received in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties.) But the Harrisburg-based G.O.P. pollster James Lee insists that this year could be different. \u201cThe Democrats have 900,000 more voters in this state than Republicans,\u201d Lee says. \u201cDespite that, in the primaries only 89,000 more Democrats than Republicans turned out to vote. Now, some of that is because the Clinton-Sanders race wasn\u2019t as energizing. But because both Trump and Clinton have such high unfavorable ratings, there are indications that the overall turnout in Pennsylvania this November could be far lower than it was the past two cycles. And that means fewer minority and college-age voters in Philadelphia and the collar counties.\u201d", "Lee points out that in the last low-turnout presidential year, 2004, John Kerry beat George W. Bush in Pennsylvania by only 140,000 votes. At this stage, Lee says, Trump is significantly outperforming Bush in the state\u2019s 16 or so bellwether counties \u2014 populated in part by unionized miners and steelworkers, in addition to other lifelong Democrats who are nonetheless socially conservative. \u201cIn Cambria County, he\u2019s on track to win by twice the margin Bush did,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThe point being, if this happens in most of the swing counties, it\u2019s not hard to come up with the 140,000 votes Bush lost by in 2004.\u201d", "What these counties have in common is a predominance of white, non-college-educated voters. That demographic currently provides Trump with his greatest advantage over Clinton: 53 percent to 28 percent, according to a ", ". Exit polls in the 2008 Pennsylvania primary showed that white male voters favored Clinton over Obama, 57 to 43. While many of those voters might have been indisposed to cast their ballots for an African-American candidate, it remains a fact that they are, or were, registered Democrats \u2014 and thus are, or were, within Hillary Clinton\u2019s reach.", "\u201cThis is almost duplicative of 1980, when middle-income working-class voters in Pennsylvania became Reagan Democrats,\u201d says former Harrisburg mayor Stephen R. Reed, a Democrat who supported Clinton in 2008. \u201cHillary had a very strong appeal to those voters in 2008. If the election were held today, a lot of those voters would be inclined to vote for Trump. I think they\u2019re gettable, but there has to be additional focus by her campaign to reverse the inroads that Trump has made with them. The focus in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio has to be on the economy \u2014 creating jobs, raising the minimum wage. I\u2019d leave the other issues to the side, frankly.\u201d", "When I visited the Capitol Diner myself Wednesday, my server, a 58-year old Greek-American woman named Athena, told me that she had waited on then-Senator Clinton at the 2008 event. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice, very intelligent lady,\u201d Athena said. \u201cBut after eight years of Obama, I think she would just be a continuation.\u201d", "I asked her if she was intending to vote for Trump.

{"category": "trump", "text": ["From Hobbes and Hegel to John Stuart Mill and John Rawls, the seminal figures of Western political theory are united in their almost complete neglect of the topic of immigration. No doubt they have their reasons. Who among them witnessed anything like the global refugee crisis of 2015? Or the anxieties about national identity that it inflamed? Be that as it may, with hostility toward immigrants and refugees fueling the \u201cBrexit\u201d movement and the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, we could use some deep thinking right now about the relationship between the state and its citizens. This deep thinking would no longer start with the assumption that we already know who is included in that relationship (thanks for nothing, John Locke!), but rather would inquire how, in light of often conflicting values like local democracy and global justice, we should go about figuring that out.", "On the case is the political philosopher David Miller. His timely book ", "may not be the first treatise of its kind, but it aims to be the first to combine such an abstract approach to the topic with such a strong dose of realism. Make no mistake: Miller is a humane, social democratic Oxford University professor \u2014 a softy. But he does not wish away such stubborn, unfortunate facts as social prejudice and failed states, and he wrestles with the issue of immigration from that hard-\u00adbitten perspective. He comes down in favor of a state\u2019s right \u2014 except when human rights are threatened \u2014 to close its borders to outsiders, and proposes four principles that should govern states\u2019 selection policies when they do choose to admit immigrants.", "Miller\u2019s first principle is what he calls \u201cweak cosmopolitanism.\u201d A weak cosmopolitan believes in the equal worth of all human beings but sees this as morally compatible with giving special consideration to our compatriots. The argument is simple: The radical changes to our behavior required by a strong cosmopolitanism \u2014 which holds that we have an obligation to treat all people the same \u2014 would entail abandoning too much of what gives shape and meaning to our lives in the first place (our families, communities and so on).", "In the context of immigration, strong cosmopolitanism mandates an international \u201copen borders\u201d policy, whereas weak cosmopolitanism dictates only that a country\u2019s policy cannot violate anyone\u2019s human rights and sometimes must actively protect them, as with people fleeing genocide. Apart from that, a weakly cosmopolitan state does not have an obligation to accept any would-be immigrants. What it does have to do, out of respect for them as human beings, is provide defensible reasons for declining them. As an extreme example, Miller cites the European Union\u2019s controversial decision in 2014 to direct fewer resources to rescue missions for migrants on rickety boats in the Mediterranean. Even if you disagreed with the policy, its rationale \u2014 that the rescue missions were creating a perverse incentive for these dangerous journeys and thus ultimately imperiling more lives \u2014 was both reasoned and consistent with a belief in the value of all human life.", "Miller\u2019s second principle is national self-determination. Immigration can bring about considerable change to a country, and Miller argues that citizens of a democracy have the right to decide whether such changes would bolster or undermine their vision for their society. A nation\u2019s goals may be economic or environmental or perhaps just athletic \u2014 suggesting a policy favoring, for instance, those who can compete for a spot on an Olympic team. There is wide latitude here.", "Wide but not unlimited. Any such policies have to be consistent with weak cosmopolitanism \u2014 and also, Miller believes, with his third principle: fairness. The aim of a state\u2019s immigration policy has to be one that would-be immigrants ought to accept as reasonable (even if in practice they disagree with it). For example, it is legitimate for a state to admit only high-skilled immigrants if this serves its economic goals, despite the fact that this policy may be unpopular with low-skilled migrants. By contrast, it is illegitimate for a state to admit only people of a certain skin color, or to have a \u201ctemporary\u201d migrant policy (say, for guest workers) that in actuality creates a semi-permanent two-caste system. An unfortunate policy is O.K. An unfair one is not.", "Does that distinction seem as if it might get blurry in practice? The early history of immigration policy in America, as told by the historian Douglas C. Baynton in ", ", suggests so. Traditionally, scholars have divided that history into two periods: a \u201cselective\u201d phase starting in 1882, which in large part (aside from the Chinese Exclusion Act) involved screening out individuals with any \u201cdefect\u201d that would render them \u201clikely to become a public charge\u201d; and a \u201crestrictive phase\u201d starting with the passage of a \u00adliteracy test in 1917, which marked the beginning of a series of proxy measures for keeping out whole nationalities or races. Using Miller\u2019s principles, you might condone much of the first phase but condemn the second.", "Yet Baynton, challenging the conventional historiography, argues that the selective phase of American immigration policy, despite its heavy reliance on the \u00adsensible-sounding \u201cpublic charge\u201d standard, was no less discriminatory. During those years, he demonstrates, immigration officials could and did customarily invoke this standard to rule out such \u201cdefectives\u201d as women unaccompanied by male providers and members of races with supposed \u201cpredispositions\u201d to criminality. Even those with \u201cobjective\u201d physical impairments (as the Americans with Disabilities Act would underscore many years later) were incapable of work only if you made certain assumptions about how workplaces were to be structured. So beware \u201creasonable\u201d justifications for immigration policies, Baynton warns.", "The fourth and final of Miller\u2019s principles is social integration. This is not to be confused with assimilation; Miller is not demanding that citizenship for immigrants be predicated on giving up the identities, values and practices of their previous lives. But he is calling for certain commitments, as well as a certain flexibility, on the part of everyone involved. He has no objection, for example, to the \u201cintegration contracts\u201d that countries like France and the Netherlands have required of prospective permanent residents in recent years, which involve taking classes in (and tests of) language proficiency and civic values. The reasoning here is that as a matter of basic psychology, we are all inclined to help and sympathize with those whom we feel have something in common with us. But in the same spirit (and also in the spirit of fairness), Miller in turn expects the state to provide these immigrants with institutional support and legal protections befitting \u00adcitizens-in-training.", "Likewise, Miller argues for reciprocity with respect to cultural integration. A Muslim immigrant to Italy, he feels, should not object to the presence of a crucifix in his daughter\u2019s classroom as a symbol of the nation\u2019s Catholic heritage; but neither should her school object to her preference for modest dress and the wearing of a head scarf. Here, too, the American example is relevant. In his minutely detailed ", "the historian R. Scott Hanson uses the story of Flushing \u2014 which calls itself the birthplace of religious freedom in America and is now the hub of the most religiously diverse large county in the United States \u2014 as a \u201ccase study\u201d of the promises and drawbacks of pluralism. How religiously diverse can a society get?", "Hanson, who has also done ethnographic work in the neighborhood, concludes there is virtually \u201cno limit\u201d to how much religious diversity a society can accommodate. But he also finds that when it comes to cooperation and unity \u2014 two goals that Miller, at least, places considerable emphasis on \u2014 there are limits (social, theological, sometimes just spatial) to how much of a sense of community you can achieve in such a pluralistic environment. It\u2019s another consideration to bear in mind for those who seek to respect social cohesion as well as the rights and interests of prospective immigrants."], "date": "2017-04-05", "title": ["Deep Thinking About Immigration"]},

But he added, \u201cWhat I have also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America.\u201d", "Mr. Obama\u2019s eyes welled with tears as he spoke of his faith in the American people and urged voters to transfer their trust in him to the woman he hopes will succeed him. \u201cTime and again, you\u2019ve picked me up and I hope, sometimes, I\u2019ve picked you up, too,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me.\u201d", "It was Mr. Obama\u2019s lyrical rejection of \u201ca politics of cynicism\u201d 12 years ago to the night, as the keynote speaker of the 2004 Democratic convention, that dazzled a national audience and thrust him into the spotlight, setting him on his path to two terms in the Oval Office.", "Now, the challenge for Mr. Obama as he shifts gears for the final months of his presidency is to find a way to acknowledge that the political divides he promised to bridge have only grown deeper and more acrimonious \u2014 while arguing persuasively that the way to rise above them is to elect Mrs. Clinton and reject ", ", the Republican nominee.", "The president left it mostly to others on Wednesday to praise his record and defend his decisions, beginning in an eight-minute video that, while celebrating his major accomplishments, dwelled heavily on the challenges Mr. Obama has faced, and worked hard to excuse him for what he had not achieved, particularly on gun control.", "In his speech, Mr. Obama argued emphatically \u2014 rebuking Mr. Trump eight times by name \u2014 that the Republican nominee had played on Americans\u2019 fears rather than offered them solutions to their problems.", "\u201cAmerica is already great,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is already strong. And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.\u201d", "But the president devoted far more of his speech to Mrs. Clinton, offering himself up as a powerful force in validating her qualifications for the presidency and her moral authority.", "\u201cYou can read about it, you can study it, but until you\u2019ve sat at that desk, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to manage a global crisis or send young people to war,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut Hillary\u2019s been in the room; she\u2019s been part of those decisions.\u201d", "He continued, \u201cEven in the midst of crisis, she listens to people, and she keeps her cool, and she treats everybody with respect.\u201d", "And he expressed solidarity for her even as he alluded to her failings, and to his own. \u201cShe knows that sometimes during those 40 years, she\u2019s made mistakes, just like I have,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like we all do.\u201d", "The president left no doubt of his commitment to helping Mrs. Clinton succeed him, saying that \u201cthere has never been a man or a woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton\u201d to serve as president.", "In doing so, he was also making a vigorous argument for his vision of the country, in both its soaring possibilities and the messier realities, and asking Americans to embrace their differences and work for change.", "Implicit in Mr. Obama\u2019s political rise was the idea that if he became president he would help Americans rise above the partisan and racial divisions that cleaved the nation. It was never just about him, his aides argued in interviews this week; rather, it was Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to give voice to such widely shared aspirations that rallied voters behind him.", "In his 2004 convention speech, a testimonial to John Kerry, the Democratic nominee that year, Mr. Obama decried the \u201cspin masters and negative-ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes,\u201d and he foreshadowed the political theme that would ultimately carry him into the White House by urging \u201ca politics of hope.\u201d", "Then as now, Mr. Obama was vouching for someone else, but what many Americans actually heard was a compelling argument for his own leadership.", "In January, in his final ", ", he conceded he had fallen short. And a few weeks later, on the steps of the Illinois statehouse, where he had first become a candidate for president, Mr. Obama expressed a deep regret for \u201cmy inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics.\u201d It was, he said, one of the bitterest failures of his presidency.", "That partisan strife is also one of the chief reasons to oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the president often says: In his view, Mr. Trump would dramatically worsen, not improve, what Mr. Obama said in Springfield was a \u201cpoisonous political climate that pushes people away from participating in our public life.\u201d", "On Wednesday night, the president portrayed Mr. Trump as a nasty and divisive candidate who would govern from the White House by dividing the country into the very kinds of opposing camps that Mr. Obama argued in 2004 were unhealthy and wrong.", "The president decried what he called the \u201cdeeply pessimistic\u201d vision of America that emerged from Mr. Trump\u2019s convention in Cleveland last week \u2014 saying it offered no solutions but rather fanned \u201cresentment and blame and anger and hate. And that is not the America I know.\u201d", "Mr. Obama, whose approval ratings have risen above 50 percent, was loath to be seen as taking a victory lap, as departing two-term presidents before him have done at their conventions. Top advisers said he had rejected the idea of a valedictory address in the style of Ronald Reagan in 1988 or Bill Clinton in 2000.", "He was also keenly aware, however, that reminding voters why they gravitated to him in the first place could be the most powerful way to boost Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2014 and with it, his own chance of achieving a lasting legacy.", "Hours before Mr. Obama was to speak at the convention, word emerged that he would build his presidential library in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago, the latest reminder that he was preparing his exit and that Mrs. Clinton was, in the words of a senior adviser, \u201cthe torchbearer\u201d of his legacy.", "On Wednesday night, Mr. Obama insisted that despite the political divisions that remain, the country remains a hopeful one that will embrace the optimism of Mrs. Clinton over the bleak vision of Mr. Trump.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what Hillary Clinton understands,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis fighter, this stateswoman, this mother and grandmother, this public servant, this patriot \u2014 that\u2019s the America she\u2019s fighting for.\u201d"], "date": "2017-04-05", "title": ["Obama, at Convention, Lays Out Stakes for a Divided Nation"]}
