And it\u2019s exactly that sort of suspicion that has underscored much of the media reaction to Kickstarter, an online crowdfunding platform. More or less anyone is allowed to post a project on Kickstarter with a stated financing goal, and more or less anyone is allowed to contribute to that project. The major caveats are that the projects must be creative and that the creators must offer rewards at different tiers of contribution, much in the way that PBS offers you a tote bag if you donate a certain amount during a fund-raiser.", "In the beginning, Kickstarter seemed primarily like a venue for upstart bands or small theater companies to raise a few thousand dollars to get projects off the ground. Over the past year, though, Kickstarter has played a surprising role in gathering increasingly astonishing amounts of money for increasingly well-known artists. In March 2012, the video-game auteur Tim Schafer sought $400,000 to make a new game but ended up with $3.36 million; in May, the musician Amanda Palmer set a goal of $100,000 to record a new album and raked in more than $1 million.", "Along with a rise in the site\u2019s public profile, the media narrative about Kickstarter has changed from one of astonishment (\u201cSo, people will just give you money?\u201d) to one of skepticism (\u201cAll right, who\u2019s getting hosed here?\u201d) to the current uneasy middle ground \u2014 optimistic but ready to jettison the whole thing as soon as some opportunist abuses it to abscond with a bunch of cash. Kickstarter-financed projects that run into trouble or fail to materialize are often cited as a flaw in the model: to take only the two examples above, Schafer has documented for his backers that his project is on a pace to run over its budget, and Palmer, following her windfall, has faced criticism for soliciting free help from local musicians while on tour. The suggestion in both cases is that their Kickstarter contributors were somehow duped, like suckers who fell for a Nigerian e-mail scam.", "The common thread in all of this coverage is that it typically uses the language and logic of simple supply and demand, regarding Kickstarter essentially as a meeting place for entrepreneurs and investors. Which is a big reason the site\u2019s success seems so hard to explain. Kickstarter, like the box of Magic cards I was given, is baffling by the tenets of a self-serving marketplace. (\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for him?\u201d was the question my mother was trying in vain to answer.) And if you allow for things like file-sharing \u2014 and many Kickstarter rewards and projects are the types of things that could be pirated, like games, albums or films \u2014 then it becomes fairly clear that pretty much none of the people donating have a purely economic incentive to participate at all. Why not just let everybody else finance this new album and download a torrent of it later?", "But Kickstarter backers aren\u2019t investors, and they aren\u2019t looking for the project that will give them the greatest return on their money. Kickstarter does not function as a store (as its Web site goes to great pains to remind you), any more than PBS is \u201cselling\u201d you a tote bag in exchange for your donation. Kickstarter as a phenomenon is made much more comprehensible once you realize that it\u2019s not following the logic of the free market; it\u2019s following the logic of the gift.", " \u201cDebt: The First 5,000 Years,\u201d the anthropologist David Graeber examines our history of debt and money, concluding, in part, that humans do not naturally tend toward impersonal, reciprocal exchange. Instead, exchange usually develops in cultures first as a part of a larger social and cultural ritual. One of the most compelling cultures Graeber profiles is the Tiv of West Africa, who have very particular rules about exchange. For starters, they believe that bringing an economic transaction to full completion is essentially immoral, or at least frowned upon, because it implies that one party doesn\u2019t want anything to do with the other in the future. If a Tiv man or woman gives you a gift, you are supposed to respond with another gift of slightly greater or lesser value. The outstanding debt between the two of you is a signal that your relationship is going to continue. To respond with a gift of equal value would be to say implicitly that you wish to even things out and draw your relationship to a close.", "Kickstarter is run according to a similar form of gift logic. The artists create a short video, explaining themselves and conveying their personality. People contribute to them because they\u2019re friends who know the artist personally; they\u2019re fans engaged in a highly personal if unidirectional relationship with the artist; or simply because they\u2019re intrigued by the project and want some sense of participation in it. (Though it has been estimated that only 10 to 20 percent of contributors find projects this way, through the Kickstarter site rather than through the artists\u2019 own social-media promotions \u2014 and on average, these people donate less money.)", "In response to the contribution, as in Tiv custom, the artist gives something of slightly greater or lesser value to the person who contributed. And it\u2019s almost always the case that the rewards for donations have a lower market value than the money being asked for (much like that public-television tote bag). There\u2019s one notable reason for this: the highly personal logic of the gift exchange, a transaction by which a personal relationship is strengthened, not diminished.", "There\u2019s also an odd symbiosis created by Kickstarter, a reversal of the way the culture industry traditionally operates. On Kickstarter,if not enough backers pony up, the project quite likely won\u2019t exist at all. This makes its projects oddly impervious to piracy. If all your potential fans are freeloaders inclined to download something only if it\u2019s free, your project won\u2019t be financed in the first place, and there will be nothing for them to pirate.", "Some critics of Kickstarter have objected to the transaction fees collected by the site itself, which is the source of its revenue. Josh MacPhee, writing in The Baffler (for which Graeber often writes as well), complained that Kickstarter extracts value from social networks while giving nothing social in return.", "Admittedly the interaction with Kickstarter Inc. is an impersonal, business transaction, but it\u2019s not an exploitative one: artists choose to use Kickstarter because it\u2019s a known entity, it adds some legitimacy to their projects and helps them with presentation. Communities flock to donate to Kickstarter projects for the same reasons. And it\u2019s not correct to say that Kickstarter gives nothing back. To the contrary, it provides something increasingly rare in today\u2019s society: a platform for an essentially noneconomic transaction, the kind that builds friendships and communities. Some of the more innovative users of Kickstarter, like Schafer, have even offered a kind of forum membership as a donation reward; an invitation into a place where fans can congregate and socialize online, much as I did in my early teenage years.", "And unlike the individual projects featured on the site, Kickstarter, the business, is susceptible to market forces. If at some point we all decide that its fees are too high, there\u2019s nothing to stop people from migrating to any of Kickstarter\u2019s increasing number of competitors, like Indiegogo or RocketHub. Kickstarter is replaceable, in competition with other more-or-less-equivalent services, and it keeps no relationship with us after we\u2019ve donated. We are free to leave it whenever we please.", " another writer inspired by gift economies, published \u201cThe Gift,\u201d an examination of the nature of the creative impulse and its relationship to the market economy. Hyde emphasized the forward motion of the gift, arguing that artistic creation is propelled by eros, or love, rather than the logos of number-crunching, and as such it is incapable of being subsumed by the market. Even if art is sold, the forces that led to its existence operate according to the need to share something with the world. Hyde\u2019s focus on the artist as creator and gift-giver is narrower than Graeber\u2019s more historical approach, but it made \u201cThe Gift\u201d a sensation and an inspiration to writers like Margaret Atwood and David Foster Wallace. And if Graeber\u2019s work helps us understand the psychology of crowdfunding, then Hyde\u2019s work is vindicated by Kickstarter\u2019s success. The desire to make art has always been inherently social, not economic, and now, even in a society defined by the free market, the means to produce art can come from an inherently social mechanism as well.", "As with the Tiv, on Kickstarter, the reward gift doesn\u2019t bring the transaction to completion. After financing a project and dispensing rewards, artists who use Kickstarter are in a permanent debt to the fans who supported them. This is borne out by their actions: pretty much no one who has had a successful Kickstarter project has ever been able to shut up about how thankful they are. Many have subsequently donated to or helped promote other projects. And if the artists don\u2019t show the appropriate reverence for their benefactors, public opinion can turn nasty. The reaction against Palmer\u2019s use of others\u2019 volunteer labor occurred not because her call for free help indicated some maddening market inefficiency.

Tears rolling down their cheeks, they couldn't stop laughing or keep their contagion of chuckles from spreading to almost half the other girls at their boarding school. Some fits were lasting minutes, others hours, some up to 16 days, until exasperated administrators closed the school five months later. Afflicted girls were sent home to their villages around Lake Victoria, where they duly infected more children and young adults with their ''sickness.'' Before the epidemic finally relented, in 1964, it forced the temporary closing of more than 14 schools, all because of unstoppable laughter.", "What was so funny no one ever discovered, but the mirth gathered a momentum that caught hundreds of unsuspecting villagers in its riptide. At the time, it was considered a pathology to be quarantined and quashed. But today, this unmoored laughter is celebrated in over 1,000 laughter clubs worldwide as a therapy to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, strengthen the immune system and perhaps even lead to world peace.", "The first club began with Dr. Madan Kataria, known as the Giggling Guru, in Bombay. In 1995, having read about the health benefits of hasya (laughing) yoga, he gathered a few friends in a park where they told jokes to one another. But over time the jokes fell flat or got smutty, so Dr. Kataria developed a catalog of comical expressions and sounds that he and his confreres used to stimulate and simulate laughter. The guiding principle was that while humor can fail to produce the expulsion of air and muscle contractions known as laughter, forced laughter always works because it transcends thought.", "Dr. Kataria's trick worked. His most famous stance, the lion laugh (eyes bulging, voice roaring and hands pawing the air), got even the most world-weary laughing. His group grew, meeting regularly to force laughter into the morning air. By 1998, it was a movement, with 12,000 people gathering at a Bombay racetrack to celebrate the first World Laughter Day, a day that this year was celebrated here and in India on May 5.", "Since then, laughter clubs have been erupting all over the world. They were introduced to America through Dr. Kataria's friend Steve Wilson of Columbus, Ohio, a self-described ''joyologist'' and former psychologist who trains club leaders and was a co-founder of the World Laughter Tour Inc., a clearinghouse for what participants call the American laughter movement. Naturally the group has a Web site (www.worldlaughtertour.com) directing the curious to local chapters or ''a Certified Laughter Leader in your area.''", "''The human spirit always comes back to laughter,'' said Mr. Wilson, who is also known as the Cheerman of the Bored. ''Misery loves company, but laughter loves it more. It's a sign of health and perseverance. We've got 5,000 years of proof.''", "Human beings, of course, have been laughing a long time. Robert Provine, a behavioral neurobiologist at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, believes that the first laugh rang out about six million years ago, when hominids first stood upright, a position that allowed for respiratory control and freed the lungs and larynx to laugh. Laughter developed, he writes in ''Laughter: A Scientific Investigation'' (Viking, 2000), before language, and was the result not of jest, but of fear, giddiness, disappointment -- a passing mammoth. Mr. Provine, who has recorded hundreds of episodes of people laughing, says that some 90 percent of our laughter is not the direct result of a specific joke.", "Laughter has been the subject of serious speculation for a long time. Plato was wary of the sound's effect on the republic's guardians and wanted it censored. Aristotle argued for moderation: excess laughter was for ''buffoons.'' By the Renaissance, laughter studies had emerged. In the 17th century, Hobbes supported the superiority theory, which held that laughter was a ''sudden glory that arises'' when we realize how great we are compared to everyone else. (Perhaps that's what behind the gleeful mirth of the evil genius in the old James Bond films.) Later, Kant and Schopenhauer thought laughter arose from incongruity, that is, when events don't conform to expectations (30 clowns emerge from a tiny car). And third, the relief theory, best elucidated by Freud, says that we laugh to release pent-up energy. Recall that passing mammoth.", "These theories aside, laughter's health benefits have been touted for centuries. Norman Cousins's 1979 book, ''Anatomy of an Illness,'' describes beating cancer with ''Candid Camera'' episodes and Marx Brothers films; the Viennese psychiatrist Viktor Frankl wrote that at Auschwitz laughter was ''another of the soul's weapons in the fight for self-preservation''; and the seventh-century Zen monks Kanzan and Jittoku believed in laughter as the path to inner peace.", "For Stephan Wischerth, a certified laughter club leader in New York, no one needs a reason or a theory to laugh. Each week, he leads a handful of men and women in laughter at Healing Works Midtown Manhattan, a center that offers free holistic programs to low-income people.", "''I'm not making anyone laugh,'' Mr. Wischerth explained. ''We're not laughing at -- we're just laughing. We're giving each other license to laugh without embarrassment.'' After breathing and stretching exercises, followed by the laughter movement's mantra, ''Ho-Ho-Ha-Ha-Ha,'' Mr. Wischert is ready to begin.", "''Have you had a vowel movement today?'' he asks, bending low and then stretching up in a moan that ends in a shriek-laugh, his face resembling the ''before'' photo of an Ex-lax commercial. The three others -- a registered nurse, an outreach worker, a minister -- follow suit with bulging veins and red faces. The room fills with the groan of vowels stretching into laughter. More exercises follow: the opera laugh, the chicken laugh, the subway laugh. The ''Why Me?'' laugh begins as a parody of misery and weeping, but the falsetto repetition of this threadbare query demonstrates, after about 45 seconds, that William Blake was right: ''Excess of sorrow laughs.''", "Still, Mr. Provine, the behavioral neurobiologist, says there is little scientific evidence that laughter is good for you. ''The presumed health benefits are few and far between,'' he said. Rather, laughter may be a side effect of good health.", "''Laughter is about relationships,'' he said. ''It may not be laughter that is healthy, but the environment -- the friends and family -- that lead to laughter. Laughter probably doesn't make us live longer, but if you like it, go for it.''", "Laugh clubbers are. Mr. Wilson dreams of the day when he'll lead the United Nations in a lion laugh for peace, and Dr. Kataria wants to see the Olympics begin with a laugh. Laughter is certainly more democratic now than it was back in Voltaire's day, when aristocrats went to the local asylum and taunted the inmates to get some kicks."], "date": "2017-03-17", "title": ["Got the Giggles?
