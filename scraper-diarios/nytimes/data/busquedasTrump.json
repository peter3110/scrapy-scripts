More of them were sold in 2015 in the Dallas and Houston areas than in the entire state of California, according to the research firm IHS Markit. There is the Ford F-150 King Ranch, named for the iconic Texas ranch. And the Nissan Texas Titan, the floor mats and tailgate of which are emblazoned with the shape of Texas.

The auto journalists who make up the <a href=\"http://texasautowriters.org/\">Texas Auto Writers Association</a> steer dozens of trucks and S.U.V.s through rocky, muddy off-road trails, critique the vehicles\u2019 appearance and performance, and vote on the winners.

Mr. Spell, a former president of the auto writers group and a founder of the rodeo in the early 1990s, drove 38 vehicles in 48 hours. At one point, I was at a cocktail social with auto executives sorting through my bag of truck swag (the Ram cup koozies were clever). At another, I was gripping the grab handle inside a Ford F-150 Raptor as it chewed up the countryside when I made the mistake, midbump, of asking the driver how fast we were going.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"135\" data-total-count=\"3466\">Seth Goslawski, the Ford engineer behind the wheel, had no idea. \u201cLooking at your gauges,\u201d he explained, \u201cgets you in trouble.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"57\" data-total-count=\"3523\">I learned later we were doing at least 90 miles per hour.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"261\" data-total-count=\"3784\">The Nissan Titan XD had been named the Truck of Texas in 2015, and there was a lot of chatter at the rodeo about whether it would repeat, but my stuntman-style ride with Mr. Goslawski gave me a bias toward the Raptor. It kept me alive. I liked it a whole bunch.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

I, on the other hand, had trouble making my way back to the hotel in my sedan on Day 1 of the rodeo and smacked into a deer. We both survived, but let\u2019s just say there was some nervousness at the rodeo as I got behind the wheel of a Ram Power Wagon and a Nissan Titan.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"441\" data-total-count=\"4666\">I was worried about damaging the trucks until Nissan\u2019s Mr. Diaz told me that a rodeo journalist once took an S.U.V. off the off-road and plunged it, purposely, into a river. Indeed, my time on the most rugged hilltop trail was surprisingly luxurious. We could have towed 18,000 pounds, but with our leather-wrapped heated steering wheels, chrome grilles and computer-controlled driving aids, it seemed we were selecting the Yacht of Texas.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"4978\">At the outdoor awards ceremony, everyone gawked at the two-handled Truck of Texas trophy.

In the late 1990s, when the people in Stuttgart switched from air-cooled to water-cooled engines, loyalists were certain the move caused the financial collapse in Southeast Asia and tsunamis in Papua New Guinea. Perhaps even that dreadful movie \u201cArmageddon.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"344\" data-total-count=\"701\">It could be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. With the 2017 model year, all 911s are now turbocharged. That\u2019s right: Technically it means you can buy a base Carrera and crow to your friends you own a 911 turbo, which you would, just not a Turbo <em>model</em> (which still exists, with fender intakes and 540 horsepower, so that\u2019s quite a white-lie buster).</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"466\" data-total-count=\"1167\">Visually, only eagle-eyed Porschephiles will spot the redesigned front and back fascia, doors and a rear air intake that gulps more air on the 2017 version. No controversy there. The twin-turbo version of the flat-6 engine is smaller now at 3 liters and more fuel-efficient. It also packs additional horsepower \u2014 420 in the Carrera S Cabriolet model I drove, which drinks premium fuel at a rate of 20 miles per gallon city, 28 highway, according to the government.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"1420\">And then there\u2019s the torque \u2014 368 pound-feet of it delivered in a wonderfully linear manner from 1,700 through 5,000 r.p.m., whereas the outgoing engine\u2019s power built progressively as the revolutions built up. Enthusiasts should hug the engineers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"377\" data-total-count=\"1797\">This new motor is more drivable, especially when teamed to the 7-speed manual transmission I\u2019m rowing. The 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic gearbox is a brilliant piece of machinery. Both transmissions are redesigned. A starting price of $90,450 for a base hardtop coupe will save most of us from having to choose between the two. As tested, the Cabrio just clears $135,000.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"2039\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Going from the hard top coupe to Cabrio costs around $12,000. The updated leather interior in Bordeaux red sets you back $4,280, and the sport seats are another $2,320. Can\u2019t do without the Spyder Design wheels? That\u2019ll be $2,370, please.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"185\" data-total-count=\"2224\">Manual 911s dash from standstill to 60 miles an hour in about 4 seconds, while the PDK \u2014 which stands for Porsche Doppelkupplung, not Pretty Darn Kwik \u2014 is a couple of ticks faster.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"291\" data-total-count=\"2515\">Sonically, the 911\u2019s precision clockwork-on-amphetamines characteristic remains, save for a whisper of a whistle added by the turbos that should be a deal breaker only to those sensitive to ultrasonic dog whistles. That symphony of mechanical delight is deliberately guided into the cabin.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"489\" data-total-count=\"3004\">Corner hard and the 911\u2019s heroic abilities feel different from those of the midengine Cayman and Boxster. The rear-engine 911 essence is a perceptively heavier tail that\u2019s easier to rotate in a controlled manner. Brakes scrub speed off like nobody\u2019s business. Front vents and an active rear spoiler improve aerodynamics on the fly. Drop the perfectly tailored fabric top (something you can do while moving at speeds up to 30 m.p.h.) and air management in the cockpit is well managed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"392\" data-total-count=\"3396\">Not much changes in the familiar cabin, which treats eyes and fingers to materials with visual and tactile heft. The world\u2019s most over-engineered cup holders spring from the dashboard, and the new entertainment system is fully modern with pinch-to-zoom features, Google Maps and Apple CarPlay. A front-axle lift option means steep driveways will no longer keep people from owning a Porsche.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"165\" data-total-count=\"3561\">The \u201cfrunk\u201d is roomier than you might expect; two carry-on suitcases will fit. Anything else will need to go in the back seat. I use the term \u201cseat\u201d loosely.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"403\" data-total-count=\"3964\">To those who would rather buy a Miata and pocket the extra $100,000, your frugality is commendable; the Mazda is a fun romp. Know that the 911\u2019s precision and gravitas are on a whole different level. It\u2019s why second mortgages were invented. Loyalists may approach turbocharging across the board with trepidation, but newcomers to the brand should simply feel free to enjoy the evolution of a legend.</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on June 10, 2016, on Page B3 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: The Porsche 911, Redesigned and Revved Up. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/driven\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Video Review: Porsche 911 Redesign Is Revved Up - The New York Times</title>"]},

Often, these contracts guarantee a specific amount of revenue, The Times found, which can send water bills soaring.</p>", "<p class=\"interactive-summary\">\n                Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life.            </p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"328\" data-total-count=\"1603\">Water rates in Bayonne have risen nearly 28 percent since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts \u2014 one of Wall Street\u2019s most storied <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about private equity.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">private equity</a> firms \u2014 teamed up with another company to manage the city\u2019s water system, the Times analysis shows. City officials also promised residents a four-year rate freeze that never materialized.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"188\" data-total-count=\"1791\">In one measure of residents\u2019 distress, people are falling so far behind on their bills that the city is placing more liens against their homes, which can eventually lead to <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about foreclosures.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">foreclosures</a>.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"483\" data-total-count=\"2274\" id=\"story-continues-3\">In the typical private equity water deal, higher rates help the firms earn returns of anywhere from 8 to 18 percent, more than what a regular for-profit water company may expect. And to accelerate their returns, two of the firms have applied a common strategy from the private equity playbook: quickly flipping their investment to another firm. This includes K.K.R., which is said to be shopping its 90 percent stake in the Bayonne venture, a partnership with the water company Suez.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"286\" data-total-count=\"2560\">Rich Henning, a Suez spokesman, said that \u201cBayonne had chronically underinvested in their water and sewer infrastructure, which has certainly contributed to rate increases during the past few years.\u201d He added, \u201cWe understand that these increases create stresses for ratepayers.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"472\" data-total-count=\"3032\" id=\"story-continues-5\">President-elect Donald J. Trump has made the privatization of public works a centerpiece of his strategy to rebuild America\u2019s airports, bridges, tunnels and roads. Members of his inner circle have sketched out a vision, including billions of dollars of tax credits for private investors willing to tackle big infrastructure projects. And Mr. Trump himself promised in his victory speech \u201cto rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"458\" data-total-count=\"3490\">Private equity firms like K.K.R. have already presented themselves as a willing partner, and Bayonne provides an important case study. Its arrangement is one of a handful of deals across the country in the last few years in which private equity firms have managed public water systems. While these deals are a small corner of private equity\u2019s sprawling interests, they represent the leading edge of the industry\u2019s profound expansion into public services.</p>", "<p id=\"nytd-series-summary\" class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"78\" data-total-count=\"3568\">For residents, the financial trade-offs from these water deals can be painful.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"543\" data-total-count=\"4111\">The Times analyzed three deals in which private equity firms have recently run a community\u2019s water or sewer services through a long-term contract. In all three places \u2014 Bayonne, and two cities in California, Rialto and Santa Paula \u2014 rates rose more quickly than in comparable towns, which included both publicly and privately run water systems. In Santa Paula, where Alinda Capital Partners controlled the sewer plant, the city more than doubled the rates. A fourth municipality, Middletown, Pa., raised its rates before striking a deal.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"307\" data-total-count=\"4418\">Now, some of these cities are trying to take back their water. Missoula, Mont., wrested away its water system, which had been owned by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/carlyle-group-lp?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More information about Carlyle Group LP\" class=\"meta-org\">Carlyle Group</a>. Apple Valley, Calif., whose waterworks were also owned by Carlyle, has filed a similar lawsuit. Santa Paula bought its sewer plant from Alinda last year.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"4769\">Of course, there\u2019s a reason many communities look for private partners to begin with: Their water systems are in poor shape. Budget shortfalls and political mismanagement can represent a real threat to both infrastructure and citizens. For evidence, look no further than the crisis in Flint, Mich., where the drinking water became tainted with lead.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"492\" data-total-count=\"5261\">\u201cKeeping rates down may sound like the ultimate righteous good for ratepayers, but the truth is, not if you\u2019re failing to provide basic care and maintenance,\u201d said Megan Matson, a partner at Table Rock Capital, the boutique private equity firm that invested in Rialto\u2019s water and sewer system. She added that it helps for deals to \u201cprovide more obvious public benefits,\u201d noting that her firm partnered with Ullico, the nation\u2019s only labor-owned insurance and investment company.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"353\" data-total-count=\"5614\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Proponents of the public-private partnerships, citing recent studies in Canada and Europe, argue that private businesses operate more efficiently than governments do and that this translates into cost savings for citizens. And private equity firms, lacking technical expertise in how to manage infrastructure, often team up with private water companies.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"335\" data-total-count=\"5949\">Supporters also say that the deals require private equity to spend millions of dollars a year to fix things (money that towns may not spend on their own), and that the firms sometimes pay towns millions more up front. Bayonne, for instance, got $150 million up front from K.K.R.\u2019s team, which the city used to pay off a pile of debt.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"285\" data-total-count=\"6234\">In a statement, a K.K.R. spokeswoman said, \u201cOur partnership has provided Bayonne residents with better service, modernized technology to detect leaks and conserve water, improved infrastructure and safer conditions for workers \u2014 all without a tax increase or public expenditure.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"251\" data-total-count=\"6503\">In Bayonne, a city of about 65,000 on a peninsula in the shadow of the fallen twin towers, a crucial test for its private equity deal came in July 2012. By then, Bayonne had already spent nearly a year haggling with some of K.K.R.\u2019s top negotiators.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"87\" data-total-count=\"6590\">Next, city officials presented the deal to a more skeptical crowd: their own residents.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"263\" data-total-count=\"6853\">Bayonne\u2019s sales pitch to its citizens illustrates the bold steps town officials can take \u2014 including making promises that are at odds with the actual terms of the deal \u2014 to attract private equity money. Private equity, in turn, can earn significant returns.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"276\" data-total-count=\"7129\">At a public meeting in city hall, a lawyer for the city promised that, after an initial rate bump, there would be \u201ca rate freeze for four years,\u201d according to a meeting transcript. Bayonne\u2019s mayor, Mark Smith, later reiterated the four-year freeze in a magazine article.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"39\" data-total-count=\"7168\">That promise turned out to be fleeting.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"99\" data-total-count=\"7267\">The contract allowed additional rate increases after only two years. There was no four-year freeze.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"375\" data-total-count=\"7642\">In fact, rates rose even more than the Bayonne contract predicted \u2014 in part because K.K.R\u2019s team had to make unexpected infrastructure upgrades, but also because residents were using less water than expected. The contract guarantees revenue to the team \u2014 more than half a billion dollars over 40 years \u2014 so water rates have jumped, in part, to make up the difference.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"117\" data-total-count=\"7759\" id=\"story-continues-7\">The city said it saw the revenue requirement as a way for K.K.R.\u2019s team to earn steady returns, but not a windfall.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"195\" data-total-count=\"7954\">But the Times analysis showed that Bayonne\u2019s water rates grew almost 28 percent under the deal, growth that far exceeded that of three other municipalities to which Bayonne has compared itself.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"455\" data-total-count=\"8409\">(Daniel Van Abs, an associate professor at Rutgers University who specializes in water management, said that a true apples-to-apples comparison of water rates in different towns was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d because of the different factors that can influence rates, including the size of the utility, the municipality\u2019s population, droughts and infrastructure investment \u2014 or lack thereof. The Times analysis for Bayonne did not include sewer rates.)</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"277\" data-total-count=\"8686\">Former Bayonne officials who had promised the four-year rate freeze said in interviews that they had not meant to mislead residents. They said they had earmarked some of the K.K.R. team\u2019s $150 million up-front payment to offset rate increases in the contract\u2019s early years.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"109\" data-total-count=\"8795\">But then voters ousted Mayor Smith.

He also <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2015/12/bayonne_to_be_hit_with_1325_percent_water_rate_hik.html\">blamed the previous administration</a> for guaranteeing too much revenue to K.K.R.\u2019s team in the early part of the deal, calling those figures \u201cwildly optimistic.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"9703\">Bayonne officials also stress the deal\u2019s benefits, including the up-front payment that let Bayonne pay off more than $100 million in old debts. Within three months, Moody\u2019s Investor Service revised the city\u2019s debt outlook from \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201cstable\u201d for the first time in five years, and it has since upgraded the city\u2019s credit rating.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"9945\" id=\"story-continues-8\">K.K.R.\u2019s team contributes about $2.5 million annually to pay for repairs to water infrastructure, plus $500,000 to the city itself. K.K.R. and Suez said they have upgraded their safety equipment and replaced inoperable hydrants around town.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"291\" data-total-count=\"10236\">They also installed sophisticated water meters that can detect leaks in people\u2019s homes, and sent nearly 2,000 letters to customers warning when such leaks occurred. As such, use has declined, according to Mr. Henning, who said Suez had received \u201cmany notes of thanks\u201d for the warnings.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"10489\">But more-sensitive meters could lead to higher bills for some residents whose water use wasn\u2019t fully captured in the past.

One reason is that people who fall behind on payments face long-term risks: Unpaid water and sewer bills can be sold to investors who try to collect on that debt, a common practice across the country. Failure to pay can ultimately lead to foreclosure.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"316\" data-total-count=\"11802\">In 2012, the year Bayonne struck its deal, water bill delinquencies led to 200 government liens against local properties, tax records show.

And yet federal spending on water utilities <a href=\"http://bluefieldresearch.com/us-municipal-water-infrastructure-forecast-reaches-532-billion/\">has declined</a>, prompting state and federal officials to try to play matchmaker, courting private investors to fix what needs fixing.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"276\" data-total-count=\"12921\">For years, the Obama administration has been cheerleading public-private partnerships.

But Table Rock said rates were artificially low after the city had declined to raise them for about a decade, giving it the lowest rates among those towns. And unlike in most other deals, Rialto residents had a say in the increases and ultimately approved them in a public vote, as required under state law. This year\u2019s rate increase was delayed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"212\" data-total-count=\"15047\">When the deal closed in 2012, all the public water utility employees kept their jobs.

So, months before, he had supported Carlyle\u2019s purchase of the regional water company (Park Water) that owned Missoula\u2019s local system (Mountain Water), believing that Carlyle would then sell Mountain Water back to his town.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"33\" data-total-count=\"16606\" id=\"story-continues-13\">But the mayor\u2019s plans derailed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"145\" data-total-count=\"16751\">In October 2013, Missoula made an informal offer to buy its local system. Carlyle declined. Missoula made a formal offer. Carlyle declined again.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"298\" data-total-count=\"17049\">Missoula then sued, and it won. But the court decided the system was worth $88.6 million, substantially more than what the city had offered. On top of that, the city must spend millions of dollars on legal and other fees and must also pay some of its opponents\u2019 costs, according to court records.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"212\" data-total-count=\"17261\">Those costs included lawyers\u2019 fees, limo services and dinners at some of Missoula\u2019s finest restaurants.

Further costly repairs are still needed, for one thing.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"167\" data-total-count=\"17947\">For Carlyle, the deal was a financial success. The firm sold Park Water in January to another private company for $327 million, more than double what Carlyle had paid.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"183\" data-total-count=\"18130\">Missoula is not the only city seeking control over its infrastructure. Last year, Santa Paula bought its wastewater recycling plant for about $70 million from <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=25778336\">Alinda Capital Partners.</a></p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"18502\" id=\"story-continues-14\">Alinda, which specializes in infrastructure investing, had teamed up with a private water recycling company to finance, design, build and operate the plant after the city awarded them the contract in 2008. The new facility, Alinda noted, replaced an old plant owned by Santa Paula that had been violating state environmental regulations, saving the city from paying fines.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"414\" data-total-count=\"18916\">But after years of raising sewer rates, partly to pay \u201cservice fees\u201d to Alinda, Santa Paula\u2019s thinking changed: It would be better for Santa Paula to issue its own debt to purchase the plant than to saddle citizens with annual rate increases. Now the town \u2014 at the urging of its city manager, Jaime Fontes, and several council members, including Ginger Gherardi \u2014 has started issuing rebates to citizens.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"176\" data-total-count=\"19092\">Still, there will be bumps along the road. After all, cities like Missoula and Santa Paula are now responsible for running an important, and occasionally messy, public service.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"204\" data-total-count=\"19296\">Soon after Santa Paula regained control of its sewer plant, an equipment failure let partly treated wastewater pour from the plant. The discharge turned a pond green and flowed onto a nearby organic farm.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"75\" data-total-count=\"19371\">And wastewater, Mr. Fontes said, is \u201cnot the kind of organic you want.\u201d</p>", "<p>Rachel Abrams contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

The language used by the International Monetary Fund was typical: It expressed fears of an \u201cabrupt reaction,\u201d adding that this \u201cmay have already begun.\u201d The head of the organization, Christine Lagarde, said that the consequences of Brexit would range from \u201cpretty bad to very, very bad.\u201d The Bank of England warned of a recession, a contraction in gross domestic product and an increase in unemployment. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published a paper called \u201cThe Economic Consequences of Brexit,\u201d predicting a \u201cmajor negative shock to the U.K. economy.\u201d Even pro-Brexit economists expected an immediate downturn: Gerard Lyons, former economic adviser to the prominent Brexiter Boris Johnson, said that the trajectory would resemble the \u201cNike swoosh\u201d \u2014 down then up.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"876\" data-total-count=\"1846\">What happened instead was that Britain enjoyed the best growth of any major advanced economy in 2016. The doomsayers have been quick to point out that Brexit hasn\u2019t actually happened yet, so all the promised shock has been postponed rather than averted \u2014 which, for the record, is what I think, too. Still, it\u2019s all a bit embarrassing for everyone who made those overconfident forecasts. Andy Haldane, the chief economist for the Bank of England, which was one of the sources of those doomy prognostications, agrees. He compared the pitfalls of economic prediction to the single most famously wrong weather forecast in British history, made on the BBC on Oct. 15, 1987. A woman had called the BBC to say she was worried there was a hurricane on the way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there isn\u2019t,\u201d the weatherman responded. That night, 22 people died amid hurricane-force winds.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"646\" data-total-count=\"2492\">This isn\u2019t the first time Haldane has been critical of the current state of macroeconomics \u2014 that\u2019s the big-picture, whole-economy side of the profession. Last fall he gave an important, broad-ranging speech with the elegant title \u201cThe Dappled World,\u201d in which he argued that the unexpected global downturn that began in late 2007 has left behind \u201ca crisis in the economics and finance profession.\u201d Economic forecasts on the eve of the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, he says, \u201cnot just wrong but spectacularly so.\u201d The overall trajectory of precrisis forecasts was upward; the reality was a brutally deep capital V.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"947\" data-total-count=\"3439\">The reason this poses a deep intellectual crisis for macroeconomics is that the entire point of the field, as it has developed since the work of John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, is to prevent just this sort of severe downturn. Keynes once spoke of a future in which economists would be \u201chumble, competent people on a level with dentists,\u201d while the brilliant up-and-coming French economist Esther Duflo recently gave an admired I.M.F. lecture called \u201cThe Economist as Plumber.\u201d It seems to me, though, that what macroeconomists do is really most like bomb disposal. Uniquely in the social sciences and humanities, macroeconomics was developed with a specific, real-world purpose, and a negative purpose to boot: to stop anything like the Great Depression from ever happening again. Given this goal \u2014 to avert systemic crises and downturns \u2014 the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, for macroeconomics, an intellectual disaster.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"899\" data-total-count=\"4338\" id=\"story-continues-2\">In retrospect, the failure of the discipline to predict and prevent the crisis was based on deep conceptual faults. One of these concerned a mysterious refusal to engage with the role of the banking and finance system in the economy. Another was the assumption that the discipline makes about individual motivations, assuming that individuals \u201coptimize\u201d their decision-making to behave, in economic terms, rationally. This is a convenient intellectual shortcut for building models, but it is also a fiction, as we know not just from our own human experience but even from within economics itself, where microeconomics has recently made exciting progress in the study of human irrationality, bias and cognitive error. It is a matter of provable fact that our decision-making is not entirely rational. Economic models built on the premise of our rationality will always have a creaky underpinning.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1155\" data-total-count=\"5493\">The focus of Haldane\u2019s speech is on this second point. He talks about the need for macroeconomics to learn from other disciplines in both the natural and social sciences in order to seek \u201ca different perspective on individual behavior and systemwide dynamics.\u201d He argues that the profession has \u201cborrowed too little from other disciplines\u201d and become \u201ca methodological monoculture,\u201d with the associated risk that everybody in the field can be wrong in the same way and at the same time. He finds compelling evidence in a survey of American professors of social science, who were asked whether \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d knowledge was better than knowledge \u201cobtained by a single discipline.\u201d Most social scientists sensibly thought that the answer was yes, by overwhelming margins. But 57 percent of economists disagreed or strongly disagreed. Economists literally think they have nothing to learn from anyone else. The field also suffers from its rigid hierarchies and its lack of gender and racial diversity. As Haldane puts it, \u201cIt is difficult to escape the conclusion that economics remains an insular, self-referential discipline.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"805\" data-total-count=\"6298\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Haldane\u2019s proposed solution to the problem lies in an emerging new field called agent-based modeling, in which large amounts of computer power are used to build models where individual actors have their own motives and their own agency. These agents collide and overlap and interact and generate predictions through a messy process more akin to real life than the clean models of old-fashioned macroeconomics. Agent-based modeling has been shown to have promise in other fields, especially physics \u2014 and also in modeling real-world problems like the tendency for Brazil nuts to levitate toward the top of the mixed-nut package. (That might sound kooky, but Haldane points out that the nut research \u201chas since found real-world applications in industries such as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.\u201d)</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1335\" data-total-count=\"7633\">Haldane isn\u2019t the only prominent nonacademic economist to think there are profound problems in macroeconomics. Paul Romer is a highly regarded macroeconomist who recently became chief economist at the World Bank. (It was Romer who is credited with having coined, in 2004, the famous slogan that \u201ca crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\u201d) Last winter he, too, issued a lacerating critique of his field, titled \u201cThe Trouble With Macroeconomics.\u201d His argument focuses on the question of \u201cidentification,\u201d which is shorthand in the field for how economists identify the cause of an event. Identification is a huge deal for economics, because if you can\u2019t tell if x, y or z caused something, you don\u2019t know which of those variables to study or measure or change. The omission of finance and the role of money from economic models is the biggest weakness in the field, Romer believes. It is hard for noneconomists to get our heads around the fact that the dominant macroeconomic models (including the ones used by central banks) made no allowance for how money works \u2014 especially not for fluctuations in how much of it is around. Such an oversight seems weird, and entirely counterintuitive. But that\u2019s what happened, and it played a big role in macroeconomists\u2019 ability to, as Romer puts it, \u201cdismiss mere facts.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1126\" data-total-count=\"8759\">The Bank of England and the World Bank are two of the most important noncommercial banks in the world. It is striking, and exhilarating and scary too, that the chief economists of these two institutions each thinks that their trade is in crisis. Not so long ago, leading macroeconomists thought that the main part of their work was basically over. The Nobel winner Robert Lucas claimed as much in his presidential address to the American Economic Association in 2003. Macroeconomics, he said, \u201chas succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved.\u201d That now looks wildly hubristic. Maybe the field is roughly where physics was at the end of the 19th century, when some scientists thought that their own field\u2019s main problems had been solved, within a Newtonian framework that is now known to be inadequate to describe reality. Maybe, like physics in the 20th century, macroeconomics is about to have a heroic period. If it does, it will begin in the work of people like Romer and Haldane, who are unflinchingly willing to talk about its huge recent failures. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.<span class=\"tombstone\"><i class=\"icon\"></i></span></p>", "<p>John Lanchester has written eight books, including the novel \u201cCapital\u201d and, most recently, \u201cHow to Speak Money: What the Money People Say \u2014 and What It Really Means.\u201d</p>", "<p><em>Sign up for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine\">our newsletter</a> to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.</em></p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2017, on Page MM14 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">Sunday Magazine</span> with the headline: The Major Blind Spots in Macroeconomics. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/on-money\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>The Major Blind Spots in Macroeconomics - The New York Times</title>"]},

In the United States, Syngenta pays academics like James W. Simpkins of West Virginia University, whose work has helped validate the safety of its products. Not only has Dr. Simpkins\u2019s research been funded by Syngenta, he is also a $250-an-hour consultant for the company.

Back then, Syngenta had not yet been formed, but she said one of its predecessor companies, Ciba-Geigy, tried to stifle her research by citing a confidentiality agreement signed by her employer then, a Swiss government research center called Agroscope.</p>", "<p id=\"nytd-series-summary\" class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"323\" data-total-count=\"3717\">Confidentiality agreements have become routine.

Many studies linked the chemicals to a mysterious collapse of bee colonies that was in the news. Other studies, many backed by industry, pointed to the varroa mite, and some saw both factors at play.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"156\" data-total-count=\"6194\">Dr. Cresswell\u2019s initial research led him to believe that concerns about the pesticides were overblown.

The British government ranks universities on how useful their work is to industry and society, tying government grants to their assessments.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"6967\">\u201cI was pressured enormously by my university to take that money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a traveling salesman and having the best possible sales market and telling your boss, \u2018I\u2019m not going to sell there.\u2019 You can\u2019t really do that.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"57\" data-total-count=\"7024\">The issue soon came up at Dr. Cresswell\u2019s dinner table.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"259\" data-total-count=\"7283\">\u201cMe and my mum were like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re taking money,\u2019\u201d his daughter Fay, now a 21-year-old university student, recalled of the conversation that took place. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an argument, but it did get quite heated.

He said in a statement that up to 15 percent of university research in Britain was funded by industry. \u201cIndustry sponsors are fundamentally aware that they will receive independent analysis that has been critically evaluated in an honest and dispassionate manner,\u201d Mr. Sandes said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"46\" data-total-count=\"7699\">But the degree of independence is in question.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"387\" data-total-count=\"8086\">Dr. Cresswell and Syngenta agreed on a list of eight potential causes of bee deaths to be studied. They discussed how to structure grant payments. They reviewed research assistant candidates. Dr. Cresswell sought permission from Syngenta to pursue new insights he gained, asking at one point, \u201cPlease can you confirm that you are happy with the direction our current work is taking?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"416\" data-total-count=\"8502\">But he also pushed back at times. An email from Syngenta to the university said that Dr. Cresswell \u201cwill have final editorial control,\u201d but Dr. Cresswell, in another email, expressed concern that a proposed confidentiality clause \u201cgrants Syngenta the right to suppress the results,\u201d adding, \u201cI am not happy to work under a gagging clause.\u201d He says the term of the clause was reduced to only a few months.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"228\" data-total-count=\"8730\" id=\"story-continues-8\">Neonicotinoids are now subject to a moratorium in the European Union. A <a href=\"http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news-and-media/news/new-study-neonicotinoid-insecticides-linked-wild-bee-decline-across-england\">recent study</a> by Britain\u2019s Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology attributed a population loss of at least 20 percent of many kinds of wild bees to the pesticides.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"206\" data-total-count=\"8936\">Syngenta and its competitors argue that the real culprit is a disease called varroosis, which is spread by varroa mites. The Bayer Bee Care Center in Germany <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/business/energy-environment/accused-of-harming-bees-bayer-researches-a-different-culprit.html\">includes menacing sculptures</a> of the little pest.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"212\" data-total-count=\"9148\">But Dr. Cresswell\u2019s initial research for Syngenta did not support the varroosis claims. \u201cWe are finding it pretty unlikely that varoosis is responsible for honey bee declines,\u201d he wrote to Syngenta in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"188\" data-total-count=\"9336\">An executive wrote back, suggesting that Dr. Cresswell look more narrowly at \u201closs data\u201d of beehives rather than at broader bee stock trends, \u201cAs this may give a different answer!\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"314\" data-total-count=\"9650\" id=\"story-continues-10\">For the next several weeks, the company repeatedly asked Dr. Cresswell to refocus his examination to look at varroa. In another email, the executive told Dr. Cresswell, \u201cit would also be good to also look at varroa as a potential uptick factor\u201d in specific countries where it could have exacerbated bee losses.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"261\" data-total-count=\"9911\">In the same email, part of a chain with the subject line \u201cVaroosis report,\u201d he also asked Dr. Cresswell to look at changes in Europe, rather than worldwide. Dr. Cresswell agreed and said, \u201cI have some other angles to look at the varoosis issue further.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"10168\">By changing parameters, varroa mites did become a significant factor. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to the view that varoosis is potent regarding colony loss at widespread scale,\u201d Dr. Cresswell wrote in January 2013. A later email included scoring that bore that out.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

Looking back, Dr. Cresswell said that while he still thought concerns about the pesticides were overblown, aspects of his project were inevitably influenced by the nature of the relationship.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"221\" data-total-count=\"11038\" id=\"story-continues-11\">\u201cYou can write it up as, Syngenta had an effect on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t actually deny that they didn\u2019t.

Environmentalists saw him as an adversary, and his industry connection came to define him in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/22/bees-pesticides\">news </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/22/bees-pesticides\">articles</a>. When he was called to testify before Parliament, <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/126217\">Dave Goulson</a>, a biology professor at the University of Sussex, sat next to him. Dr. Goulson likened taking money from agrochemical companies to taking money from the tobacco industry, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes-aren-t-addictive.html?pagewanted=all\">long denied</a> that cigarettes were addictive.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"58\" data-total-count=\"11552\">Some people thrive on controversy.

He said that he began to feel \u201cI was virtually incompetent,\u201d adding that he would put his head on his desk and think his work was a mess. He ended up leaving his job for several months. Although he presented his research publicly, it was never published.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"115\" data-total-count=\"12051\">In an interview, Dr. Goulson said, \u201cI\u2019ve known James for a very long time and always thought he was a good guy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"12308\">\u201cYou can\u2019t win,\u201d Dr. Goulson added. \u201cIf you are funded by industry, people are suspicious of your research. If you\u2019re not funded, you\u2019re accused of being a tree-hugging greenie activist. There\u2019s no scientist who comes out of this unscathed.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"12504\" id=\"story-continues-13\">Today, Dr. Cresswell has returned to less controversial areas of bee research. He says he respects scientists he has met from Syngenta, but views collaboration with industry as a Faustian bargain.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"41\" data-total-count=\"12545\">He called Syngenta \u201ca kind of devil.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"173\" data-total-count=\"12718\">\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realize is that supping with them would actually have a broader impact on how the world sees me as a scientist,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my misjudgment.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"127\" data-total-count=\"12867\" id=\"story-continues-14\">If some scientists struggle to reconcile themselves with taking corporate money, others embrace complex business relationships.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"204\" data-total-count=\"13071\">James W. Simpkins, a professor at West Virginia University and the director of its Center for Basic and Translational Stroke Research, is one of many outside academics whom Syngenta turns to for research.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"188\" data-total-count=\"13259\">He has focused on the Syngenta product atrazine \u2014 the second most popular weed killer in America, widely used on lawns and crops \u2014 often co-authoring research with Syngenta scientists.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"283\" data-total-count=\"13542\">Atrazine, banned in the European Union, has also been controversial in America. Most notably, Syngenta started a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/10/a-valuable-reputation\"> campaign to discredit</a> Tyrone B. Hayes, a professor it once funded at the University of California, Berkeley, when Dr. Hayes found that atrazine changes the sex of frogs.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"13806\">Dr. Simpkins has had a different relationship with the company. In 2003, he <a href=\"https://archive.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/web/pdf/072003sapmeetingtranscript.pdf\">appeared before American regulators</a> on Syngenta\u2019s behalf, saying that \u201cwe can identify no biologically plausible mechanism by which atrazine leads to an increase in prostate cancer.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"494\" data-total-count=\"14300\">Dr. Simpkins was also lead author of a 2011 study finding no support that atrazine causes breast cancer. And last year, he was part of a small team of Syngenta-backed scientists that fought California\u2019s move to require that atrazine be sold with a warning label. He also recently edited a series of papers on atrazine for Syngenta, garnering praise from a senior researcher at the company, Charles Breckenridge, who wrote in an email that the \u201cpapers tell a simple, yet compelling story.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"466\" data-total-count=\"14766\">The depth of the financial intertwining of Dr. Simpkins and Syngenta was laid out in nearly 2,000 pages of email traffic, obtained by The Times after a Freedom of Information Act request. Not only does Dr. Simpkins receive research grants, but the company also pays him $250 an hour as a consultant for his work on expert panels, studies and manuscripts, records show. Syngenta even asked Dr. Simpkins to contribute to Dr. Breckenridge\u2019s annual performance review.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"15019\">Asking outsiders to contribute to corporate reviews is not unusual. However, Dr. Simpkins is also described in the emails as a partner in a venture set up by Dr. Breckenridge called Quality Scientific Solutions to consult on pesticides and other issues.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"391\" data-total-count=\"15410\" id=\"story-continues-15\">West Virginia University\u2019s website says that \u201cresearch conducted at W.V.U. is data-driven, objective and independent\u201d and \u201cnot influenced by any political agenda, business priority\u201d or \u201cfunding source.\u201d And John A. Bolt, a university spokesman, said that all of Dr. Simpkins\u2019s Syngenta-related research had been conducted before Dr. Simpkins arrived at West Virginia in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"258\" data-total-count=\"15668\">But a review of Dr. Simpkins\u2019s published work shows that he wrote favorable atrazine studies with Syngenta scientists <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831581\">in 2014</a> and 2015, and listed his university affiliation. Mr. Bolt said Dr. Simpkins only \u201cserved as an expert adviser\u201d in the studies.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"284\" data-total-count=\"15952\">In 2014, Syngenta made a $30,000 donation to the university\u2019s foundation. Mr. Bolt said that the donation was made \u201cin general support of the research activities of Dr. James W. Simpkins.\u201d None of the money, Mr. Bolt said, was \u201cused to support research related to Syngenta.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"277\" data-total-count=\"16229\">Dr. Simpkins\u2019s collaborations with Dr. Breckenridge appear to be expansive. In an email to Dr. Simpkins last year, Dr. Breckenridge sent him a study on the Mediterranean Diet and suggested that they use a multilevel marketing company to help them sell a product of their own.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"133\" data-total-count=\"16362\">\u201cIf we could come up with a better Snake Oil,\u201d he wrote to Dr. Simpkins, \u201cwe would have access to a massive marketing force.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"71\" data-total-count=\"16454\">Some scientists labor outside the industry. It can be a difficult path.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"320\" data-total-count=\"16774\">Angelika Hilbeck worked for Agroscope, a Swiss agricultural research center, in the 1990s, when she began to examine genetically modified corn. The corn was engineered to kill insect larvae that fed on it, but Dr. Hilbeck found that it was also toxic to an insect called the lacewing, a useful bug that eats other pests.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"349\" data-total-count=\"17123\">Ciba-Geigy, a predecessor of Syngenta, had a confidentiality agreement with Agroscope, and insisted that she keep the research secret, she said. Confidentiality agreements are not unusual for Agroscope. In one such agreement obtained by The Times, the agency agreed to return or destroy corporate documents it received as part of a research project.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"200\" data-total-count=\"17323\">Dr. Hilbeck said she refused to back down and eventually published her work. Her contract at Agroscope was not renewed. An Agroscope spokeswoman said the episode took place too long ago to comment on.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"428\" data-total-count=\"17751\" id=\"story-continues-16\">Dr. Hilbeck continued as a university researcher and was succeeded at Agroscope by J\u00f6rg Romeis, a scientist who had worked at Bayer and has since co-authored research with employees from Syngenta, DuPont and other companies. He has spent much of his career trying to debunk Dr. Hilbeck\u2019s work. He followed her lacewing studies by co-authoring his own, finding that <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/genetically_modified_food/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about genetically modified food.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">genetically modified crops</a> were <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00436.x/full\">not harmful</a> to the lacewing.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"17961\">Next, after Dr. Hilbeck co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/articles/2008/a-00634.pdf\">a paper</a> outlining a model for assessing the unintended risks of such crops, Dr. Romeis was lead author of an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n2/full/nbt1381.html\">alternative approach</a> with a Syngenta scientist among his co-authors.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"319\" data-total-count=\"18280\">Then, in 2009, Dr. Hilbeck was an author of a paper looking at <a href=\"http://stopogm.net/sites/stopogm.net/files/cry3Bbschmidt.pdf\">risks to ladybug larvae</a> from modified crops. Dr. Romeis followed by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20740377\">co-authoring a study</a> that found \u201cno adverse effects\u201d to ladybug larvae. In subsequent publications, he referred to work by Dr. Hilbeck and others as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n5/full/nbt.2578.html\">bad science</a>\u201d and a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161661\">myth</a>.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"85\" data-total-count=\"18365\">\u201cThey were my little stalkers,\u201d Dr. Hilbeck said. \u201cWhatever I did, they did.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"252\" data-total-count=\"18617\">In an interview, Dr. Romeis, who now leads Agroscope\u2019s biosafety research group, said, \u201cHer work does not affect our mission in any way,\u201d adding that the idea of researching the effects of genetically modified crops was \u201cnot patented by her.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"269\" data-total-count=\"18886\">Refereeing a scientific dispute is difficult. But Dr. Romeis and his collaborators do seem preoccupied with Dr. Hilbeck\u2019s work, judging from a review of email traffic between Agroscope and the U.S.D.A. obtained by The Times after a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"241\" data-total-count=\"19127\">In 2014, as Dr. Romeis was developing a paper assailing Dr. Hilbeck\u2019s work, one U.S.D.A. scientist, Steven E.

Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"354\" data-total-count=\"3129\">In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"259\" data-total-count=\"3388\">But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate \u2014 and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"3645\">China\u2019s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world\u2019s largest consumer market.

As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China\u2019s importance to American technology companies \u2014 and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple\u2019s consumer sales.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"369\" data-total-count=\"4413\">A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"4751\">It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren\u2019t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren\u2019t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn\u2019s negotiations.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"391\" data-total-count=\"5142\">The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their \u201csupport\u201d for iPhone production, calling the benefits a \u201cpreferential policy.\u201d The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"311\" data-total-count=\"5453\">As China\u2019s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company\u2019s size and scale \u2014 and the sway that they afford in China \u2014 is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple\u2019s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn\u2019s largest customer.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"339\" data-total-count=\"5792\">The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn\u2019s only customer here.

Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"222\" data-total-count=\"6014\">In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government\u2019s infrastructure support.

But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"287\" data-total-count=\"10142\">The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn\u2019s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"232\" data-total-count=\"10374\">The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"24\" data-total-count=\"10417\">Apple was late to China.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"355\" data-total-count=\"10772\">In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company\u2019s co-founder, Steven P.

Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"178\" data-total-count=\"11273\">\u201cThis is a machine that is made in America,\u201d Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"350\" data-total-count=\"11623\" id=\"story-continues-9\">Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"409\" data-total-count=\"12032\">Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths \u2014 design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"186\" data-total-count=\"12218\">\u201cThey have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple\u2019s growth,\u201d said Joe O\u2019Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"303\" data-total-count=\"12521\">When Apple\u2019s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn\u2019s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"317\" data-total-count=\"12838\">Foxconn\u2019s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"303\" data-total-count=\"13141\">\u201cThe reason Foxconn\u2019s so big is Terry Gou,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. \u201cHe said he\u2019d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"304\" data-total-count=\"13445\">After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China \u2014 unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"128\" data-total-count=\"13573\">\u201cThese have become like Olympic competitions,\u201d said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"271\" data-total-count=\"13844\" id=\"story-continues-10\">The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China\u2019s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"14182\">City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"236\" data-total-count=\"14418\">The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"215\" data-total-count=\"14633\">\u201cWe know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,\u201d said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"348\" data-total-count=\"14981\">The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"173\" data-total-count=\"15154\">\u201cI was impressed,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. \u201cThey were very focused.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"203\" data-total-count=\"15381\">When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"115\" data-total-count=\"15496\">But Apple initially had to take the \u201cHong Kong U-turn\u201d to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"269\" data-total-count=\"15765\" id=\"story-continues-11\">Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government\u2019s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"208\" data-total-count=\"15973\">Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports \u2014 hence, the U-turn employed by many companies.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"289\" data-total-count=\"16262\">In 2005, Apple\u2019s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country\u2019s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"318\" data-total-count=\"16580\">\u201cThis was really a legacy of China\u2019s old export-oriented economy,\u201d said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. \u201cBack then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"54\" data-total-count=\"16634\">Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"384\" data-total-count=\"17018\">By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"310\" data-total-count=\"17328\">In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city\u2019s airport, to expedite Apple\u2019s global shipments.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"204\" data-total-count=\"17532\">Although it wasn\u2019t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturing facility.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"459\" data-total-count=\"17991\">A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"109\" data-total-count=\"18100\" id=\"story-continues-12\">As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple\u2019s global tax strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"226\" data-total-count=\"18326\">In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"360\" data-total-count=\"18686\" id=\"story-continues-14\">The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company\u2019s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"321\" data-total-count=\"19007\">\u201cU.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cIn doing so, they create stateless income \u2014 income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"348\" data-total-count=\"19355\">According to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the \u201choly grail of tax avoidance.\u201d The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"320\" data-total-count=\"19675\">Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"171\" data-total-count=\"19846\">In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city\u2019s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"270\" data-total-count=\"20116\">In August 2014, the city\u2019s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss \u201cdeepening collaboration\u201d with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the \u201cbiggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"327\" data-total-count=\"20443\" id=\"story-continues-15\">There were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation\u2019s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city\u2019s tax revenue was rapidly rising.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"55\" data-total-count=\"20498\">Officials had a name for it all: \u201cZhengzhou Speed.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"137\" data-total-count=\"20657\">A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"177\" data-total-count=\"20834\">They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones \u2014 up to 350 a minute.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"113\" data-total-count=\"20947\">Apple\u2019s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"174\" data-total-count=\"21121\">As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees.

In November 2014, China\u2019s State Council, the country\u2019s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"189\" data-total-count=\"22468\">The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"364\" data-total-count=\"22832\">But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals \u2014 in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a <a href=\"http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/Executive%20Summary%202016.pdf\">new form of \u201ctechno-nationalism.\u201d</a></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"23089\">\u201cThe government wants to know what you can give to China,\u201d said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. \u201cAnd they have the market and the muscle. They\u2019re not playing around anymore.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"316\" data-total-count=\"23405\">Chinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"303\" data-total-count=\"23708\">China is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increased <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/business/international/china-cyber-security-regulations.html\">oversight of the internet</a> with new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"214\" data-total-count=\"23922\">Apple has agreed to the government\u2019s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers.

Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/technology/apple-puts-1-billion-in-didi-a-rival-to-uber-in-china.html\">invested $1 billion</a> in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"375\" data-total-count=\"24587\">Mr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple\u2019s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country\u2019s top leaders, including Mr. Xi.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"408\" data-total-count=\"24995\">In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a \u201cpillar of its environmental strategy.\u201d He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple\u2019s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country.

The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/eric-trumps-trip-to-uruguay-cost-taxpayers-97830-in-hotel-bills/2017/02/03/ababd64e-e95c-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html?utm_term=.08a01739e157\">reported</a> that when Eric visited Uruguay on business in January, the trip cost taxpayers nearly $100,000 in hotel bills for the required Secret Service agents and for embassy staff members. Also echoing through the office at Trump Tower was the dust-up over the decision by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829356871848951809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Nordstrom</a> and several other retailers to stop selling their sister Ivanka\u2019s clothing line.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"161\" data-total-count=\"2951\">Don Jr. called that \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and both brothers said their father was right to take Nordstrom and other retailers to task publicly in Ivanka\u2019s defense.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"34\" data-total-count=\"2985\">\u201cHe\u2019s Papa Bear,\u201d Eric said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"447\" data-total-count=\"3432\">Despite pressure to do so, President Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include a stake in a half-dozen office buildings, more than a dozen golf courses and at least 15 hotels that the company owns or manages. Instead, he has signed over control of day-to-day operations of his privately held company to the two sons and Allen Weisselberg, a trusted lieutenant at the Trump Organization, with an agreement not to discuss company business.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"426\" data-total-count=\"3858\">The arrangement and the president\u2019s decision to not release his taxes have brought widespread criticism from liberal groups and even the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-conflicts-of-interest.html\">federal government\u2019s top ethics watchdog</a>, Walter M. Shaub Jr., the director of the Office of Government Ethics. President Trump has continued to frequent his commercial properties, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/donald-trump-shinzo-abe-golf-mar-a-lago.html\">including</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/donald-trump-shinzo-abe-golf-mar-a-lago.html?_r=0\">over the</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/donald-trump-shinzo-abe-golf-mar-a-lago.html\"> weekend in Florida</a>, bringing them global media attention and potential new customers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"526\" data-total-count=\"4384\" id=\"story-continues-5\">But the brothers say they are convinced that they and their father have taken sufficient steps to create a management structure that will allow them to avoid creating the kind of appearance of conflict of interest that plagued Hillary Clinton as secretary of state while her husband continued to operate the Clinton Foundation. The measures they have taken, they say, have included explicit instructions to their domestic and international business partners not to reach out to anyone in the United States government for help.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"4594\">The brothers\u2019 expressions tightened and their voices rose when they were asked, in separate interviews, about suggestions that their father was using the presidency as a way to enhance the family\u2019s profits.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"303\" data-total-count=\"4897\">\u201cWho in their right mind would try to enrich themselves by spending a fortune to run against 17 seasoned politicians on the Republican side, to then go up against the Clinton machine, Wall Street, Hollywood, P.C. culture?\u201d Don Jr. asked. \u201cTo use that as the way to enrich yourself is laughable.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"5235\" id=\"story-continues-6\">The family, he added, would face heat whatever it did. If the Trump Organization sold its assets, there would be allegations of impropriety, as foreign investors would most likely be involved. If it liquidated and put the cash into the bank, he said, his father would be accused of artificially inflating interest rates for personal gain.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"336\" data-total-count=\"5571\">For critics, though, particularly Democrats in Congress, the continuation of the global operations of the Trump Organization \u2014 even if President Trump is not directly involved <strong>\u2014 </strong>is fraught with problems, with even some Republican observers questioning whether the brothers can steer clear of trouble, regardless of their intentions.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"353\" data-total-count=\"5924\">Even with no new foreign deals, the company is in a position to get tax breaks and other business inducements from state and local officials. While such incentives are hardly unusual for growing businesses, with this family business they will unavoidably raise questions of whether different players involved might be seeking special White House favors.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"255\" data-total-count=\"6179\">\u201cPeople are going to offer them sweetheart deals,\u201d said Peter Schweizer, the conservative author whose book \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/politics/new-book-clinton-cash-questions-foreign-donations-to-foundation.html\">Clinton Cash</a>\u201d argued, among other things, that Mrs. Clinton had used her position as secretary of state to favor donors to the foundation.</p>", "<p class=\"interactive-summary\">\n                The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump\u2019s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?            </p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"375\" data-total-count=\"6554\">\u201cIt is just the way it works, as it comes down to the fact that people want access to national leaders in the country, and unfortunately in the past, be it <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/27/world/qaddafi-terms-the-220000-given-billy-carter-a-loan-tied-to-business.html?pagewanted=all\">Billy Carter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/business/neil-bush-pays-50000-penalty.html\">Neil Bush</a> or <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/28/news/mn-15866\">Roger Clinton</a>, relatives become vehicles to accomplishing that,\u201d Mr. Schweizer added, referring to relatives in past administrations who drew scrutiny because of their business activities.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"471\" data-total-count=\"7025\">The two oldest brothers have worked in various roles at the Trump Organization for much of their adult lives, but without their father\u2019s daily presence \u2014 and with the departure of Ivanka from the company offices \u2014 their responsibilities have grown. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/eric-trump?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"\" class=\"meta-per\">Eric Trump</a>, 33, oversees construction and says he, not his father, is now the named officer on hundreds of Trump companies. Don Jr., 39, is in charge of commercial leasing, as well as many of the remaining companies.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"7289\">And while they share a certain younger-version-of-their-father look, their personalities are distinct. Don Jr., the Trump child with the clearest memory of the divorce that split up his family, is the most publicly confident, and the most politically conservative.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"115\" data-total-count=\"7404\">Eric appears more cautious, more worried about how what he says will be perceived. Yet neither is particularly shy.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"76\" data-total-count=\"7480\" id=\"story-continues-7\">\u201cThere has never been a Trump that is introverted,\u201d Eric said, laughing.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"218\" data-total-count=\"7698\">What is it like \u2014 after a lifetime as the sons of Donald Trump, and now business executives in their own right, and even co-stars in a reality television show \u2014 to be the sons of the president of the United States?</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"7894\">\u201cIt\u2019s bigger, it\u2019s bigger,\u201d Eric said, struggling for the right word, then turning to a superlative, a habit inherited from his father. \u201cThis is really the biggest thing in the world.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"91\" data-total-count=\"7985\">For all the talk of its global reach, the Trump Organization still has a family feel to it.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"262\" data-total-count=\"8247\">The small offices assigned to Eric, Ivanka and Don Jr. are lined up in a row, with Ivanka\u2019s, like her father\u2019s, sitting unused since she left the company and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/us/politics/ivanka-trump-house-kalorama-washington.html\">moved to Washington</a> with her husband, Jared Kushner, who is serving as a senior <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/jared-kushner-senior-adviser-white-house-trump.html\">White House adviser.</a></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"419\" data-total-count=\"8666\">During the recent snowstorm in New York \u2014 with schools closed for the day \u2014 Don Jr., who has five children, had his 9-year-old daughter in the office, sharing breakfast sent up from a restaurant downstairs. Trump Tower, by and large, seems back to normal since the building\u2019s most famous resident moved to Washington, though Secret Service agents are still stationed in the Trump Organization lobby and elsewhere.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"477\" data-total-count=\"9143\">Just days before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump announced plans to resign from hundreds of entities he controls and place his assets in a trust. The move drew sharp criticism from ethics lawyers, who said the move was window dressing because Mr. Trump, as sole beneficiary of the trust, still owns the assets, benefits financially from any money they might make and will quite likely get updates, Eric said, roughly every quarter on the financial health of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"283\" data-total-count=\"9426\">Still, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html\">assigned control of the trust</a> to Don Jr. and Mr. Weisselberg, with Eric as the sole member of what he described as an advisory council. The three men have to vote unanimously, Eric said, to make decisions regarding new deals and other major business decisions.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

Much of it he says is unwarranted. For instance, people have questioned why corporate records in Delaware do not show that the president has resigned from his companies registered there. Eric says that he has, but that it can take more than a year for records there to be updated.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"458\" data-total-count=\"10243\">And the brothers expressed irritation that their presence at their father\u2019s announcement of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/eric-donald-trump-junior-supreme-court-announcement-twitter-activity\">provoked media reports that they were not honoring the agreement</a> to stay clear of White House matters. In fact, they said, they were in Washington to visit the new Trump hotel in the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue and stopped by to say hello to their father and share in the historic moment.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"204\" data-total-count=\"10447\">Don Jr. said he knew his father was busy, and had called him only once since his inauguration. Eric said he talked to his father \u201ca few\u201d times a week. But he insisted he knew which lines not to cross.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"263\" data-total-count=\"10710\" id=\"story-continues-8\">\u201cIn the next four years, do I ever expect him to say: \u2018Hey, how\u2019s Turnberry? How\u2019s the new green? How\u2019s the new 10th tee?\u2019\u201d Eric said. In a case like this, he said, he would probably say, \u201cDad, it\u2019s great\u201d and \u201cThe property looks awesome.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"119\" data-total-count=\"10829\" id=\"story-continues-10\">He continued: \u201cAm I ever going to say: \u2018Listen. Hey, we have a tax issue\u2019? No, no, no. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"11079\">Recently the brothers stripped most of the photographs of their father and even his signature from the Trump Organization\u2019s marketing material. And the new Scion hotel chain, which the company will brand and manage, does not feature the Trump name.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"211\" data-total-count=\"11290\">Eric said they were hoping to locate Scion, offering a lower-price alternative to their Trump International Hotel brand, in large to midsize \u201ctrendy\u201d cities like Austin, Tex., Charlotte, N.C., and Nashville.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"333\" data-total-count=\"11623\">One of the first Scion locations, Eric said, could be Dallas, where the brothers and their executive team are evaluating possible sites. They are in talks with a possible partner, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, a developer based in Texas who had previously considered projects with the Trump Organization in Iraq and Turkey, where he was born.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"368\" data-total-count=\"11991\">Though the company runs the risk of becoming entangled with foreign partners on projects in the United States, and might have to deal with the suspicion that it got tax breaks and other incentives from local governments because of its ties to the White House, company officials say they decided not to stop domestic expansion because it is creating jobs for Americans.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"316\" data-total-count=\"12307\">The Trump Organization said it had dropped a host of proposed projects overseas, including <a href=\"http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/11/06/argentina/1478456754_226440.html\">Trump Office Buenos Aires</a> in Argentina; <a href=\"http://www.trumptowersrio.com/\">Trump Towers Rio</a> and<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/americas/donald-trump-hotel-rio-brazil-investigation.html?_r=0\"> Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro</a>, both in Brazil; <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.prnewswire.com_news-2Dreleases_trump-2Dhotel-2Dcollection-2Dannounces-2Dtrump-2Dinternational-2Dhotel-2D-2Dtower-2Dbaku-2D281425361.html&amp;d=CwMFaQ&amp;c=0Z6kaK2gE4DV23xJiV3durr6BPoNXbPx1co_fqsb6wM&amp;r=LFtb3COSkwqkJfmx69ZP3DdS4G7IvOm_kGiepjLlxgk&amp;m=87O0yBVqzAb4LBXEqv_Tgi49zjatzOYYVdwgQqkQ-ZY&amp;s=8E4WfskRImLFIf6DubLQlcrP2R6zh1OZpcMJ7BCutcs&amp;e=\">Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower Baku</a> in Azerbaijan; <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.jfa.nyc_portfolio_11a10-2D02-5Ftrump-2Dtower-2Dbatumi_&amp;d=CwMFaQ&amp;c=0Z6kaK2gE4DV23xJiV3durr6BPoNXbPx1co_fqsb6wM&amp;r=LFtb3COSkwqkJfmx69ZP3DdS4G7IvOm_kGiepjLlxgk&amp;m=87O0yBVqzAb4LBXEqv_Tgi49zjatzOYYVdwgQqkQ-ZY&amp;s=hicAEpXt8yZfMDs2Y9LzM9oBBN877TTZgNg9U9LyNEI&amp;e=\">Trump Tower Batumi</a> in Georgia; and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3247430-Ganti-Associates-TRUMP-RIVERWALK.html\">Trump Riverwalk in Pune, India</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"170\" data-total-count=\"12477\">Other deals still in the conceptual stage \u2014 including a possible office building in Dubai and towers in Australia, China, Israel and Vietnam \u2014 have also been shelved.</p>", "<p class=\"interactive-leadin\">\n            The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.        </p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"370\" data-total-count=\"12847\">\u201cI was the first person to raise my hand and say you should not do certain deals, as I understood the optics, as you can\u2019t build the tallest building in Tel Aviv and try to negotiate peace in the Middle East,\u201d Eric said.

The drug company is paying just under $2.5 billion for Zeltiq Aesthetics and its diet-avoiding, fat-freezing technology. It sounds like a wackier play than the dozen deals Allergan struck last year. But people pay cash for the treatment, making it less speculative than other acquisitions, such as gene therapy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"530\" data-total-count=\"897\">Allergan\u2019s deal machine received a $40 billion injection, before tax, from the well-timed sale of the company\u2019s generic drugs unit to Teva Pharmaceutical last year. Brent Saunders, Allergan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, used the pick-me-up to shrink debt and repurchase shares. He is also trying to refill the pipeline by ramping up research and development spending and acquisitions. The company\u2019s biggest drug, Botox, faces tougher competition, while its second-biggest drug, Restasis, may soon lose patent protection.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"266\" data-total-count=\"1163\">That may help explain Allergan\u2019s hunger for a deal. In addition to aesthetic drugs, it has, since the start of 2016, bought or licensed gastrointestinal drugs, gene therapy for eye disease, and long-shot treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurological disease.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"486\" data-total-count=\"1649\">Zeltiq may be a safer bet, despite its unusual beginning. It was founded after doctors noticed that children who ate Popsicles tended not to have chubby cheeks. Zeltiq applies this idea to other areas of the body. The treatment fits well with Allergan\u2019s other cosmetic surgery assets, such as Botox and Kybella, which reduces chin fat. Zeltiq customers pay out of their own pockets, rather than go through insurers and governments, which demand big discounts for more essential drugs.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"393\" data-total-count=\"2042\">Allergan is not getting the fat-freeze technique for cheap. It is paying well over 100 times Zeltiq\u2019s estimated earnings and six times its estimated 2017 revenue. Zeltiq\u2019s growth should be about 20 percent this year, about half its performance in 2016. A further slowdown, perhaps because customers question whether the service is worth the price, would mean a poor return on the purchase.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"417\" data-total-count=\"2459\">Allergan has now churned through a substantial chunk of its Teva windfall. It had about $13 billion of cash at the end of last year. That\u2019s still enough for several more deals, especially as its business should throw off $6.5 billion of free cash flow this year. The frenetic pace of the company\u2019s mergers and acquisitions, and the scattershot targets, raise the risk that the company is misspending its windfall.</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/breakingviews\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Allergan\u2019s Deal for Fat-Freezing Treatment Shows Spending for Growth - The New York Times</title>"]},

It appears that Jeffrey A. Wertkin may have tried to do just that by passing a copy of a sealed whistle-blower complaint against a Silicon Valley company to one of its employees in exchange for that amount.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"482\">Unfortunately, he never actually got the money because he was met instead by an F.B.I. agent, who arrested him. Mr. Wertkin responded \u201cMy life is over,\u201d according to a complaint filed in the Federal District Court in San Francisco.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"352\" data-total-count=\"834\">His life is certainly not over, but this perplexing case shows how hard it can be to figure out why apparently successful individuals commit white-collar crimes. More important for Mr. Wertkin, if he did what the government <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/USA-v-Wertkin-criminal-complaint.pdf&amp;hl=en_US\">outlined in the complaint</a>, this will ruin the rest of his life in ways that no one contemplates when deciding to commit a crime.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"463\" data-total-count=\"1297\">Mr. Wertkin was the epitome of success: a Ph.D. and law degree from Georgetown (full disclosure: I received my J.D. there, too), six years in the Justice Department working on whistle-blower cases involving accusations of millions of dollars of fraud, then a partnership at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, a leading Washington law firm. This was the classic career trajectory for any aspiring lawyer, complete with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/business/dealbook/jeffrey-wertkin-akin-gump.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=DealBook&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=article&amp;_r=0&amp;mtrref=scoop.nyt.net&amp;gwh=AC9000362398AD971C6F24CE1396777B&amp;gwt=pay\">$750,000 home</a>, as The New York Times reported.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"488\" data-total-count=\"1785\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The charge filed in the Federal District Court in San Francisco against Mr. Wertkin is for <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/codes/us/1994/title18/parti/chap21/sec401\">contempt of court</a>, a law that gives a judge broad power to impose a punishment for violating court rules, like failing to keep a whistle-blower complaint secret while the government investigates the fraud claims. Another charge that could be added by prosecutors is <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/641\">theft of government property</a> for taking information entrusted to the government, which can be punished by up to 10 years in prison.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"39\" data-total-count=\"1824\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Mr. Wertkin has not yet entered a plea.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"266\" data-total-count=\"2090\">It will be particularly difficult for Mr. Wertkin to avoid at least some time in prison if he is convicted because his actions were not the product of a momentary lapse in judgment, like that of Sherman McCoy in Tom Wolfe\u2019s novel \u201c<a href=\"http://www.tomwolfe.com/Bonfire.html\">The Bonfire of the Vanities.\u201d</a></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"364\" data-total-count=\"2454\">One means to seek a reduced punishment under the federal sentencing guidelines is to argue that the crime represented \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2016-guidelines-manual/2016-chapter-5#NaN\">aberrant behavior</a>\u201d by the defendant. That requires showing the offense \u201c1. was committed without significant planning; 2. was of limited duration; and 3. represents a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"732\" data-total-count=\"3186\">But Mr. Wertkin, as the government\u2019s criminal complaint describes, went to great lengths to devise an exchange that could be straight out of a spy novel, involving a code name, a secret rendezvous, text messages and a disguise. Even though it appears Mr. Wertkin has never run afoul of the law before, and his record as a lawyer shows no disciplinary actions, he would not meet the other requirements for a reduced sentence because the conduct involved a detailed plan that played out over about two months. He took many steps to cover up his identity and, perhaps worse, he may have obtained the sealed complaint before joining Akin Gump in April 2016, which would show this was an elaborate process rather than a one-time event.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"258\" data-total-count=\"3444\">Mr. Wertkin\u2019s background and otherwise exemplary work record would still be important in a potential sentencing. The focus would shift to the motivation for the crime to explain why he engaged in this type of conduct despite an otherwise successful career.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"486\" data-total-count=\"3930\">There is no word yet about Mr. Wertkin\u2019s motivation for undertaking a course of action that now looks almost laughably amateurish, but the silliness may indicate that it was the product of desperation and not a more nefarious plan. It would not be a surprise to hear that there were financial or familial pressures, or perhaps some combination of them, at the root of a decision to put an entire career at risk for an amount that was probably less than his annual pay at the law firm.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/dealbook/andrew-caspersens-charmed-life-thrown-into-turmoil.html\">recent case of Andrew Caspersen</a> shows how judges consider evidence of motive and personal flaws in sentencing, often finding that it ultimately does not excuse the commission of a white-collar crime.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"340\" data-total-count=\"4558\">Mr. Caspersen was a successful Wall Street investment banker who defrauded family and friends out of more than $38 million to finance a speculative trading binge. At the sentencing hearing, his lawyer offered evidence that the conduct was the product of a gambling addiction that drove him to keep betting on the market until he went broke.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"349\" data-total-count=\"4907\">Federal District Judge Jed S. Rakoff agreed that Mr. Caspersen suffered from an addiction, but still sentenced him to four years in prison, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/business/dealbook/determining-a-punishment-that-fits-the-crime.html?_r=0&amp;mtrref=scoop.nyt.net&amp;gwh=590D3C3C2370E51ED1B92CD39B5DF1E0&amp;gwt=pay\">pointing out</a> that \u201cit was a fraud that involved the deception of people who had a lot of faith in the defendant.\u201d Mr. Caspersen recently entered the federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa., to serve his sentence.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"397\" data-total-count=\"5304\">For a defendant like Mr. Wertkin, the criminal prosecution is just the first step in a process that will affect him for the rest of his life if he is convicted. As a lawyer, a conviction for this type of conduct is likely to be considered a crime of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d because it involves a significant breach of the duty of a lawyer to maintain the confidentiality of a client\u2019s information.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"654\" data-total-count=\"5958\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Under the <a href=\"https://www.dcbar.org/attorney-discipline/board-on-professional-responsibility/upload/CLEAN-Board-Rules-9-14-2016.pdf\">disciplinary procedures</a> in the District of Columbia, where Mr. Wertkin is a member of the bar, he would most likely be disbarred for a conviction of this type. It is possible to apply for reinstatement after five years, but that requires demonstrating there have not been any other transgressions. Even then, <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/chart_IV_2014_sold_results.authcheckdam.pdf\">a 2014 survey</a> of lawyer discipline by the American Bar Association shows that the District of Columbia did not grant any of the three applications for reinstatement after disbarment that year, and nationwide only 24 applications out of 781 were granted, so the odds of Mr. Wertkin practicing law again if he is convicted are quite low.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"6270\">The collateral consequences of a conviction can mean not being able to do some things we often take for granted. The rules vary by state, but a person convicted of a felony can lose the right to vote, own a gun, serve on a jury or enter other professions that require the applicant to prove good moral character.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"410\" data-total-count=\"6680\">On a more personal level, a conviction probably means that it will be much more difficult to get a job because some employers shy away from hiring a person who has been convicted of a crime. Even something like volunteering to coach a Little League or soccer team for one\u2019s children may not be possible if it requires a criminal background check, which may cause the organization to decline an offer to help.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"6832\">So the answer to the question whether it was worth it for Mr. Wertkin is simple in hindsight. But I suspect that it seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/white-collar-watch\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Throwing Away a Legal Career for $310,000 - The New York Times</title>"]},

Trump</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"247\" data-total-count=\"467\">During that sit-down, on Nov. 29, Mr. Cohn briefed Mr. Trump on what he regarded as the chief hurdle to expanding the economy, according to people who were briefed on the discussion: a stronger dollar, which would undermine efforts to create jobs.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"200\" data-total-count=\"667\">Mr. Cohn also argued that the bold infrastructure projects that Mr. Trump envisioned would need private-industry partners, those people said, in order to avoid weighing down the government with costs.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"33\" data-total-count=\"700\">That got Mr. Trump\u2019s attention.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"354\" data-total-count=\"1054\">The president-elect turned to the other people in the room \u2014 his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his chief strategist, Stephen K.

Two and a half months after that initial meeting, with key economic posts in the White House and cabinet still vacant, he has become the go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth. He resigned from his position at Goldman in December to become director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"388\" data-total-count=\"2005\">People with knowledge of his new role said that Mr. Cohn, a Democrat, is summoned to the Oval Office for impromptu meetings with the president up to five times a day \u2014 and that he reaches out to the president on other occasions. Mr. Trump, said one of these people, is oriented toward the bottom line when it comes to shaping policy, often asking Mr. Cohn, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"313\" data-total-count=\"2318\">The direct access to the president has been crucial as Mr. Cohn navigates a White House where Mr. Bannon and the policy director Stephen Miller are power brokers whose worldviews differ from his, and where unexpected presidential complaints, broadcast on Twitter, can significantly recalibrate the day\u2019s agenda.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"199\" data-total-count=\"2517\">Topping Mr. Cohn\u2019s current to-do list: corporate and individual tax reforms, to be carried out at the same time; improvements to infrastructure to create new jobs; and regulatory relief in general.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"193\" data-total-count=\"2710\">He is also studying how to revamp the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign to repeal \u2014 a promise that is proving to be more complicated to keep than he had expected.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"521\" data-total-count=\"3231\">Mr. Cohn is working with a health care specialist and consulting with House Republicans: Speaker Paul D. Ryan; Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader; and Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. Cohn is determining which aspects of the act may be worth keeping (allowing people to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 and mandating coverage of people with pre-existing conditions) and which may not (allowing people to sign up for health insurance outside of the typical enrollment periods).</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"263\" data-total-count=\"3494\">Orin Snyder, a corporate litigator and longtime friend of Mr. Cohn\u2019s who speaks to him regularly, said, \u201cHe is working around the clock, energized and focused like a laser beam on developing the best plan for implementing the president\u2019s economic agenda.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"287\" data-total-count=\"3781\">This account of Mr. Cohn\u2019s role in economic matters, amid the tumultuous first three weeks of the Trump administration, is based on interviews with four people who have observed or been briefed on his transition from Goldman to the White House and his early work in the administration.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"332\" data-total-count=\"4113\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Mr. Trump has already vowed to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/credit_crisis/financial_regulatory_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about financial regulatory reform.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">financial regulation</a> law that was passed in 2010, and has ordered a reassessment of an Obama-era rule requiring financial advisers to act in the best interest of their clients. The efforts have helped push up stock markets, particularly shares of financial companies.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"390\" data-total-count=\"4503\">They have also generated outrage in some quarters. \u201cThe way I see this, there was a devastating financial crisis just over eight years ago,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. \u201cGoldman Sachs was at the heart of that crisis. The idea that the president is now going to turn over the country\u2019s economic policy to a senior Goldman executive turns my stomach.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

Questions of job creation and financial regulation might fall within the purview of not only the National Economic Council but also of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 a panel of experts that has historically operated within the White House \u2014 and the Treasury secretary. But Mr. Trump indicated on Wednesday that the vacant position of council chairman would not be cabinet-level, and Mr. Mnuchin has yet to be confirmed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"310\" data-total-count=\"5414\">Mr. Cohn collaborates frequently with Mr. Kushner, who is now a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. Along with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, Mr. Cohn recently helped persuade the president not to pursue an executive order that would have rolled back rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"219\" data-total-count=\"5633\">And when Mr. Trump lashes out publicly at a major company or orders a travel ban that inspires wide criticism, from Silicon Valley to Goldman, Mr. Cohn hunkers down on the policy work, people who have observed him said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"419\" data-total-count=\"6052\">Mr. Cohn was not looking for a new job when he first encountered Mr. Kushner last year at the behest of Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent who is a mutual friend, according to two people with knowledge of that meeting. Despite the generational divide \u2014 Mr. Kushner is 36 \u2014 the men hit it off, the two people said, and after Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory on Nov. 8, a meeting with Mr. Cohn was quickly arranged.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"285\" data-total-count=\"6337\">After the initial get-together at Trump Tower, at which a range of jobs were discussed, including energy secretary and director of the Office of Management and Budget, additional talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohn quickly followed, a person who was briefed on those discussions said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"335\" data-total-count=\"6672\">On Dec. 12, Mr. Cohn\u2019s new post as National Economic Council director was announced, touching off a rapid career transition that included making extensive financial disclosures, preparing to sell or forfeit an enormous amount of Goldman stock and walling himself off from pending matters that could have posed a conflict of interest.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"254\" data-total-count=\"6926\">Still, Mr. Cohn\u2019s 26-year career at Goldman, where he performed an array of jobs, including trading commodities, running mortgages and eventually overseeing day-to-day operations, ended with a remarkable windfall: cash and stock valued at $285 million.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"189\" data-total-count=\"7115\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Ms. Warren and other critics, who have raised questions about Mr. Cohn\u2019s communications with Goldman employees on policy matters since joining the government, find that sum objectionable.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"193\" data-total-count=\"7308\">A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and a spokesman for Goldman said in a statement that the firm had not been involved in formulating any of the president\u2019s executive orders.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"535\" data-total-count=\"7843\">Since relocating to Washington, Mr. Cohn has lived in a hotel near the White House, traveling by cab early each day to his new office in time for an 8 a.m. senior staff meeting with Mr. Priebus. At the urging of Dina H. Powell, a former Goldman colleague who is now a presidential adviser, Mr. Cohn hired Jeremy Katz, a former George W. Bush aide, as his deputy. Kenneth Juster, another Bush administration veteran who had become a partner at the private-equity firm Warburg Pincus, was put in charge of international economic affairs.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"8194\">Business interests have been central in Mr. Trump\u2019s early governing, and he has met with chief executives from, among others, Dow Chemical, Tesla and Under Armour to discuss job creation and border taxes. He has also met with the heads of food corporations, financial-services companies and airlines. Mr. Cohn was present for most of those meetings.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"296\" data-total-count=\"8490\">On taxes, regulations and health care initiatives, \u201cI give them an A-plus,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign who was briefly considered for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cRegarding trade and the dollar, I\u2019m giving them an incomplete.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"8750\">Corporate tax reform should be on an even faster trajectory, Mr. Kudlow added. \u201cThe longer you wait on that, the longer economic activity will be postponed.

Whether a given chunk of your savings should be in stocks, bonds or cash depends on your appetite for risk and when you\u2019re going to need that money.

If you think President Trump and his policies are bad, there\u2019s a natural tendency to think that this will soon be reflected in share prices. That could turn out to be true. But politics makes us stupid.

It is optimism about those policy priorities that has driven the market rally since Election Day. Throw in some extra government spending on the military and public infrastructure, and you have a recipe for speedier growth.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"220\" data-total-count=\"3347\">Maybe the pragmatic, pro-business figures in the Trump administration will prevail in internal battles, meaning that, whatever you think of the broader policy agenda, there could be boom times for corporate bottom lines.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"43\" data-total-count=\"3390\">There are, of course, darker possibilities.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"319\" data-total-count=\"3709\">President Trump could spark a trade war that could turn into a global recession. Military conflict could break out with a major trading partner like China or could disrupt oil supplies in the Middle East. And a small crisis could spiral into something bigger because of Mr. Trump\u2019s seat-of-the-pants management style.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"290\" data-total-count=\"3999\">Whatever probability you assign to positive and negative outcomes, it\u2019s hard to dispute that the range of possibilities for what the global economy will look like in four years is uncommonly large. All else being equal, more variation in the economic future means that stocks are riskier.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"301\" data-total-count=\"4300\">It\u2019s also true that by many measures stock valuations are high. Investing $100 in the S.&amp;.P 500 buys only about $4.69 in annual earnings, down from $5.06 before the election.

If you are planning to tap into those investments in the next few years and a 25 percent drop would be devastating, that\u2019s all the more reason to limit your exposure to the market. Stocks tend to offer good long-term returns, but can deliver low or negative returns for many years at a time.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"258\" data-total-count=\"4927\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Moving money out of stocks because you need it within the next few years and can\u2019t stomach that kind of risk is one thing.

The debate is politically delicate, but changing realities on the ground \u2014 in Japan\u2019s factories and fields \u2014 are forcing politicians to catch up. Japan\u2019s total foreign-born labor force topped one million for the first time last year, according to the government, lifted in part by people entering the country on visas reserved for technical trainees.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"96\" data-total-count=\"2035\">That growth has also led to an increase in cases of worker abuse and fraud, labor activists say.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"197\" data-total-count=\"2232\">Ms. Liu is part of that debate. She arrived in Japan in debt after paying brokers $7,000 to arrange her visa. Once there, she said, she found onerous working conditions and lower-than-promised pay.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"49\" data-total-count=\"2281\">Her bosses, she said, \u201ctreat us like slaves.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"219\" data-total-count=\"2526\">Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers at her factory came to Japan through a government-sponsored internship program. Its purpose is to square the circle between Japan\u2019s labor shortage and its ban on low-wage immigration.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"129\" data-total-count=\"2655\">Farms, food-processing businesses and many manufacturers would struggle to stay afloat without foreign trainees, specialists say.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"2807\">\u201cPractically every vegetable in the supermarkets of Tokyo was picked by a trainee,\u201d said Kiyoto Tanno, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"365\" data-total-count=\"3172\">To appease business groups, the government has created immigration loopholes, and hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers like Ms. Liu have poured through them. They come from China and Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia, and they are filling empty jobs in Japan as the Japanese population shrinks, becoming a crucial if underacknowledged motor of the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"279\" data-total-count=\"3451\">Their numbers are soaring. The trainee program has doubled in size in the last five years, to over 200,000, according to official data, and the government is planning to expand it. The biggest source of workers has been China, but much of the recent growth has come from Vietnam.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"224\" data-total-count=\"3675\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Few doubt that \u201ctraining\u201d is a fig leaf. Beyond a short period of language study, most trainees receive little or no instruction that would distinguish them from regular manual laborers, specialists and participants say.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"226\" data-total-count=\"3901\">\u201cThe system is like calling a crow white,\u201d said Yoshio Kimura, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who heads the party\u2019s labor committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really doing is importing labor.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"314\" data-total-count=\"4215\">Training is not the only way around Japanese immigration restrictions. There are also students in part-time jobs, asylum seekers waiting for refugee applications to be processed \u2014 almost all are ultimately rejected \u2014 and South Americans of Japanese descent who can obtain special visas based on their ancestry.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"376\" data-total-count=\"4591\">Demand still outstrips supply. The number of working-age Japanese has been falling since the mid-1990s, a consequence of decades of low birthrates. Nationwide unemployment is <a href=\"http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/roudou/results/month/index.htm\">just 3 percent</a>, and in some places, jobs are simply going begging. There are three to four positions open in nursing care and construction for every person who applies, according to government surveys.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"237\" data-total-count=\"4828\">Eventually, Japan plans to lengthen the maximum time that trainees can stay in the country to five years, from three, and allow more kinds of businesses to hire them, including nursing homes and cleaning companies for offices and hotels.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"200\" data-total-count=\"5028\">Parliament approved the creation of a new agency to oversee the trainee program last year, in response to criticism over worker exploitation. Once it is in place, the plan is to bring in more workers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"265\" data-total-count=\"5293\">Mr. Kimura and some other lawmakers want to go further, by establishing a formal guest worker system. Though it would not open a path to immigration \u2014 workers would still be expected to go home eventually \u2014 it would be more forthright than the current approach.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"191\" data-total-count=\"5484\">Business groups favor the proposal, and the Liberal Democrats approved it as party policy in May. The government of Prime Minister <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/shinzo_abe/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Shinzo Abe.\" class=\"meta-per\">Shinzo Abe</a> has not indicated whether it will follow through.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"84\" data-total-count=\"5568\" id=\"story-continues-5\">\u201cIf we want economic growth in the future, we need foreigners,\u201d Mr. Kimura said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"151\" data-total-count=\"5746\">Nobuya Takai, a lawyer who has represented foreign trainees in labor disputes, said the pretense that trainees are not workers contributes to problems.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"440\" data-total-count=\"6186\">Companies do not hire them directly, but through a byzantine system of government and private-sector middlemen. Most trainees end up thousands of dollars in debt to pay broker fees before they even arrive, say Mr. Takai and others who have studied the program. And because trainees cannot easily switch jobs \u2014 their visas tie them to a single company \u2014 they lack what should be major leverage: the ability to walk out on a bad employer.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"84\" data-total-count=\"6270\">\u201cThey can\u2019t change jobs, and they lose money if they go home,\u201d Mr. Takai said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"528\" data-total-count=\"6798\">In 2011, an American State Department <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2011/\">report on human trafficking</a> flagged the trainee program for what it said were inadequate protections against \u201cdebt bondage\u201d and other abuses. When trainees don\u2019t save enough to repay broker fees, they sometimes stay on illegally. Almost 6,000 did so in 2015, according to Japan\u2019s Justice Ministry. (There are about 60,000 foreigners total in Japan without valid visas, according to the government, compared with an estimated 11 million unauthorized <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/29/us/trump-unauthorized-immigrants.html\">immigrants</a> in the United States.)</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"226\" data-total-count=\"7024\">The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen trainees.

The co-op said that Kishimoto had been imposing \u201cpenalty\u201d overtime on both Japanese and Chinese workers, in violation of labor rules, and that Kishimoto had compensated the employees after the co-op intervened. Mr. Kishimoto said the company had fully complied with labor laws.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"408\" data-total-count=\"8940\">Government data on workplace accidents shows that trainees are more likely to be hurt on the job than Japanese workers \u2014 a result of poor training, language barriers or more dangerous assignments. Since 2010, two trainee deaths have been recognized by the government as cases of karoshi, the Japanese term for death by overwork.

And even when studies show a new technology is overused, retrenchment is very slow and seemingly haphazard.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"315\" data-total-count=\"824\">Back surgery is a great example. In the early 1990s, when John Wennberg\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/\">Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare</a> first started tracking treatment rates among older <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival health news about Medicare.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Medicare</a> users, back surgery was relatively uncommon; 1992 rates were as low as one case per thousand in cities as diverse as New York and Johnson City, Tenn.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"327\" data-total-count=\"1151\">By 2006, average rates of back surgery had increased to 4.9 per thousand. The procedure had spread rapidly across the Northern Plains and Mountain States. Growth was especially significant in certain cities elsewhere \u2014 like Lubbock and Harlingen, Tex. Yet rates in New England and some parts of the Midwest had barely budged.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"237\" data-total-count=\"1388\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Even as back surgery\u2019s popularity as a treatment for back pain began to rise in the 1990s, there was little solid evidence of its effectiveness. It wasn\u2019t until 2006 that the first large randomized trial on the subject was <a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/204281\">published</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"363\" data-total-count=\"1751\">That study showed relatively modest benefits of surgery for many conditions that lead to back pain. While many patients felt better after a year, so did a nearly equal proportion of people in the control group who didn\u2019t have surgery. However, years before that evidence was available, some regions had adopted back surgery at a high rate, while others had not.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\">This shows back surgery rates for 306 hospital referral regions from 1992 to 2014. Created by the Dartmouth Atlas Working Group, Brook Martin PhD., and Sandra Sharp.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"598\" data-total-count=\"2349\">The rates of back operations performed in hospitals began to flatten after 2006, but little was known about growth in the treatment in outpatient clinics, the same-day facilities with greater convenience and lower costs. Recently, Brook Martin and Sandra Sharp, two Dartmouth researchers funded by the National Institute of Aging, tracked outpatient as well as inpatient procedures through 2014. The finding: <a href=\"http://www.dartmouthdiffusion.org/back_surgery.php\">Rates of Medicare back surgery</a> had grown 28 percent since 2006, with no decrease in regional variations; rates in 2014 ranged from 3 per 1,000 in the Bronx to 11.5 per 1,000 in Casper, Wyo.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"218\" data-total-count=\"2567\">The puzzling thing is why back surgery became more popular in certain broad regions, but not in others. Why, for example, did rates grow so rapidly in the Northern Plain states while rates in New England barely budged?</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"482\" data-total-count=\"3049\">Our best guess comes from a study by Harvard and Dartmouth researchers, not on back surgery, <a href=\"http://econ.ohio-state.edu/seminar/papers/140116_Skinner.pdf\">but on cardiac treatments</a>. It found that regional variation in Medicare spending is associated with variation in physician preferences for intensity of cardiac treatments, and to a greater degree when the evidence is ambiguous. Patient preferences exerted almost no influence. It\u2019s likely that the pattern holds for back surgery, too, though it has not been studied in the United States.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"577\" data-total-count=\"3626\" id=\"story-continues-3\">It\u2019s tempting to conclude that there are simply regions where the intensity of care of all types is higher \u2014 that some regions invest in all of the latest shiny technologies, while others don\u2019t. This is too simple; Miami and McAllen, Tex., the two most expensive regions in the United States for overall Medicare spending, also clock in with among the lowest spine surgery rates. Instead, we see what Mr. Wennberg calls a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211114/\">surgical signature</a>: Casper Wyo., has the highest back surgery rate in the country, but its cardiac bypass surgery is well below the national average.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

Orthopedic surgeons in a particular hospital may be more aggressive, while the cardiologists there are less so.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"640\" data-total-count=\"4457\">Though we can\u2019t say this is the answer with 100 percent certainty, we can rule out some other explanations. One is how much surgeons are paid. Since Medicare pays the same price for the procedure (adjusted for cost of living) across the country, prices can\u2019t explain the paradox. The high rates in Denver could also be explained by back pain sufferers who flock to star surgeons and well-known hospitals there, but this doesn\u2019t hold water either. The way the statistics are compiled, if a medical tourist traveled from Des Moines to Denver, the Medicare record keepers would assign that operation back to the tourist\u2019s home in Iowa.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"328\" data-total-count=\"4785\">Maybe it\u2019s differences in health. Perhaps areas with rapid growth in back surgery were those where more people had back pain. Yet northern New England retirees had similar histories of hard physical labor in farming, lumbering and manufacturing, and were no more affluent than their counterparts in the Northern Plains states.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"349\" data-total-count=\"5134\">Another explanation might be that patients prefer surgery in some regions of the country. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21488247\">study</a> observed large variations in back surgery across small regions in Ontario, but these weren\u2019t explained by patient preferences. That study, like others, found physician beliefs about the benefits of surgery were associated with surgical variations.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"544\" data-total-count=\"5678\">If physicians are driving back treatment choice, even for procedures not supported by evidence, what can be done? One <a href=\"http://www.pssjournal.com/content/9/1/24\">approach</a> is to provide patients with unbiased information about the potential benefits and risks of back surgery relative to nonsurgical therapy so they can make informed choices. But the concern remains that for people in intense pain, when the doctor says that \u201cI get good results with surgery, and my patients generally feel much better,\u201d the back surgery option, with little out-of-pocket cost, will be hard to resist.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"239\" data-total-count=\"5917\">Another option is for hospitals or insurance companies to audit outlier physicians, as in a recent <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/spinal-fusions-serve-as-case-study-for-debate-over-when-certain-surgeries-are-necessary/2013/10/27/5f015efa-25ff-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html\">example</a> of a back surgeon with a pattern of unusually high billing. In his audit, nine of 10 procedures were deemed not medically necessary.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"367\" data-total-count=\"6284\">A third option is to push people toward high-quality back surgery centers. Walmart created a <a href=\"http://www.beckersspine.com/spine/item/33671-walmart-adds-mayo-clinic-to-spine-centers-of-excellence-50-copay-for-out-of-network-care.html\">network</a> of high-quality spine centers for its employees that includes Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle and the Mayo Clinic. It charged hefty co-payments to anyone getting surgery outside the network. The company found about a third of referrals didn\u2019t need back surgery.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"243\" data-total-count=\"6527\">Often discussed, the big challenge in health care is to reduce spending by cutting wasteful care. It seems just as important, though, not to let more waste creep in as it did with back surgery. Once it spreads widely, it\u2019s very hard to undo.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/about/about-austin/\">Austin Frakt</a> is a health economist with several governmental and academic affiliations.

The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"114\" data-total-count=\"401\">The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"393\" data-total-count=\"794\">The virtues of homeownership are so ingrained in the American psyche that we <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/opinion/23krugman.html\">often forget</a> that housing is also a source of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-rent-really-is-too-damn-high/254718/\">economic stress</a>. Rising milk prices are regarded as a household tragedy for some, and spiking gas prices stoke national outrage. But whenever home prices go up, it\u2019s \u201ca recovery,\u201d even though that recovery also means millions of people can <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonk/housing/atlanta/\">no longer afford to buy</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"440\" data-total-count=\"1234\">Homes are the largest asset for all but the <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/research/affordability-2016q1-12763/\">richest households</a>, but shelter is also a basic necessity, like food. We have a variety of state and federal programs devised to make housing cheaper and more accessible, and a maze of local land-use laws that make housing scarcer and more expensive by doing things like prohibiting in-law units, regulating how small lots can be, and capping the number of unrelated people who can live together.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"225\" data-total-count=\"1459\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Another big problem: High rent and home prices prevent Americans from moving to cities where jobs and wages are booming. That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"395\" data-total-count=\"1854\">So instead of looking at homes as investments, what if we regarded them like a TV or a car or any other consumer good? People might expect home prices to go down instead of up. Homebuilders would probably spend more time talking about technology and design than financing options. Politicians might start talking about their plans to lower home prices further, as they often do with <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/25/10507857-gingrich-im-the-250-gas-president-obama-is-the-10-gas-guy\">fuel prices</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"231\" data-total-count=\"2085\">In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"485\" data-total-count=\"2570\" id=\"story-continues-3\">That was the conclusion of a <a href=\"http://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/research/papers/full/802.pdf\">recent paper</a> by the economists Ed Glaeser of Harvard and Joe Gyourko at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The paper uses construction industry data to determine how much a house should cost to build if land-use regulation were drastically cut back. Since the cost of erecting a home varies little from state to state \u2014 land is the main variable in housing costs \u2014 their measure is the closest thing we have to a national home price.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"412\" data-total-count=\"2982\">According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that\u2019s what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"213\" data-total-count=\"3195\">We would still see homes of different sizes and styles \u2014 condos in some places, single-family homes in others \u2014 depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"409\" data-total-count=\"3604\">And prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. It\u2019s easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it\u2019s not <em>that</em> expensive. By the paper\u2019s calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"371\" data-total-count=\"3975\">The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project\u2019s timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"417\" data-total-count=\"4392\">People are sure to quibble with the economists\u2019 calculations, but their general conclusion \u2014 that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices \u2014 is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/closing-californias-housing-gap\">McKinsey Global Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3345\">California\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office</a> and others, have shown that California\u2019s high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn\u2019t build enough homes.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"159\" data-total-count=\"4551\">There are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/023562e2-54a6-11e6-befd-2fc0c26b3c60\">are met with increases in new building</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"503\" data-total-count=\"5054\">So let\u2019s carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/growth.pdf\">recent paper</a> by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States\u2019 economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"405\" data-total-count=\"5459\" id=\"story-continues-4\">That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"379\" data-total-count=\"5838\">Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.</p>", "<p class=\"interactive-leadin\">\n            In the priciest United States metropolitan areas, land restrictions that cap new development have pushed prices much higher than they would be\u00a0if land-use regulation were drastically cut back, according to a recent paper by two economists. \u00a0        </p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"206\" data-total-count=\"6044\">Moreover, it\u2019s likely that lower home prices would encourage workers to move farther and more often in search of job opportunities. The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"331\" data-total-count=\"6375\">There was a time, a few decades ago, when the cost of living did not vary all that much from city to city. Since then, as places like New York, San Francisco and Seattle have been hit with skyrocketing rents and home prices, the regional disparity in housing costs has altered how <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gated-City-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B005KGATLO\">Americans of different incomes pursue opportunity</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"292\" data-total-count=\"6667\">Back when home prices were more even from place to place, people with different levels of education and income tended to flock to the same types of high-wage places, according to <a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shoag/files/why_has_regional_income_convergence_in_the_us_declined_01.pdf\">research</a> by Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy at Harvard, and Peter Ganong of the University of Chicago.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address. Please re-enter.</p>", "<p class=\"error buffet-error hidden\">You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.</p>", "<p class=\"view-all-link hidden\"><a href=\"/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\">View all New York Times newsletters.</a></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"206\" data-total-count=\"6873\">Today, people with less education tend to go where housing is cheap, like Las Vegas, while college-educated workers with skills that are in demand still go to places where wages are high, like the Bay Area.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"410\" data-total-count=\"7283\">That\u2019s because lower-income people have little to gain by going to California\u2019s coastal cities. Wages might be higher, but as the state\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ccsce.com/PDF/Numbers-Sept-2016-Why-California-Poverty-Rate-Above.pdf\">poverty figures</a> show, a better paycheck doesn\u2019t help if it\u2019s swallowed by rent. The loss of mobility makes income inequality worse, because lower-wage workers are effectively locked out of exactly those places where wages and the demand for workers are greatest.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"472\" data-total-count=\"7755\">Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"340\" data-total-count=\"8095\">Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"8352\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"195\" data-total-count=\"8547\">Just as we don\u2019t expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"472\" data-total-count=\"9019\">Jeff Wilson, a college professor turned entrepreneur who refers to himself as Professor Dumpster for the year he spent living in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/learning-to-live-small-in-a-dumpster.html?_r=0\">metal trash container </a>that he turned into a home, is trying to make this happen on a small scale. Mr. Wilson\u2019s nascent company, <a href=\"https://kasita.com/\">Kasita</a>, wants to produce a line of one-bedroom homes. They would be identical in size and bought for a single price, and could be placed on city lots that traditional developers are unlikely to be interested in.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"363\" data-total-count=\"9382\">Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldn\u2019t do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"369\" data-total-count=\"9751\">For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past \u2014 brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a Sears catalog \u2014 are now sought after, so this imaginary world needn\u2019t be uglier, though it very well may be.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"353\" data-total-count=\"10104\">Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourko\u2019s data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"435\" data-total-count=\"10539\">This does not mean that select places like New York\u2019s West Village or San Francisco\u2019s Mission District would suddenly be affordable \u2014 or that American cities would suddenly fill up with towering condominiums and blocks of identical rowhouses. Housing is a regional problem, spread across miles of cities and suburbs, so a lot of new development would probably occur in close-in suburbs where there is more land than people think.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"236\" data-total-count=\"10775\">Take Boston. The median Boston suburb has a minimum lot size of one acre, and many suburbs have minimum lot sizes of one home per two or four acres. That is a huge drag on the region\u2019s overall housing supply, according to Mr. Glaeser.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"360\" data-total-count=\"11135\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Yes, adding more homes, even medium-density ones, would annoy people looking for less crowded quarters. But the nation as a whole would probably be better off, both in jobs and in financial security. The money not spent on housing could flow to other, possibly more productive, investments \u2014 like stocks in new companies or bonds for infrastructure projects.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"418\" data-total-count=\"11553\">Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time. But there could be political and societal benefits. What if local decisions that today are dictated by fears of declining property values could instead be made with an eye toward what\u2019s best for education or job growth?</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"254\" data-total-count=\"11807\">The point of this thought experiment isn\u2019t to embrace it full-on, but to open our eyes to the negatives of the national obsession of owning a home, expecting its value to rise, and using the levers of local government to keep neighborhoods as they are.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/\">The Upshot</a> provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

After the outcry, Mr. Baker <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/2017/wall-street-journal-editor-to-staff-muslim-majority-country-isnt-banned/447389/\">appeared to back off</a> and scheduled Monday\u2019s meeting, though he cited as its main purpose a discussion about the newsroom\u2019s digital future.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"359\" data-total-count=\"8569\">It will be about more than the anxieties of one newsroom. As one of the last bastions of American journalism, The Journal is a pillar of the fourth estate meant to hold the powerful to account.

Wintrich</a>, the Washington correspondent for Gateway Pundit, to attend White House press briefings and ask questions of the press secretary, Sean M. Spicer.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"407\" data-total-count=\"952\">Mr. Wintrich, an artist and writer who has collaborated with Milo Yiannopoulos, the polarizing editor at Breitbart News, attended President Trump\u2019s news conference with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, on Monday. He was joined by the owner of Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatewaypundit/status/831224734163550208\">who posted on Twitter</a>, \u201cPresident Trump just spoke about tossing criminal migrants and I wanted to stand up and cheer!!\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"281\" data-total-count=\"1233\">In a telephone interview from the West Wing, Mr. Wintrich, 28, said he would \u201cbe reporting far more fairly than a lot of the very left-wing outlets that are currently occupying the briefing room.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will be doing a little trolling of the media in general here.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"213\" data-total-count=\"1446\">Asked what kind of trolling his fellow White House correspondents might want to prepare for, Mr. Wintrich paused. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give too much away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have some pretty solid stuff planned.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"interactive-summary\">\n                Mr. Spicer typically calls on media organizations outside the mainstream before getting to more traditional news outlets.            </p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"431\" data-total-count=\"1877\">Bloggers and pundits have been granted access to White House briefings in previous administrations, and Mr. Spicer in recent weeks has taken questions from conservative talk-radio hosts and reporters at local broadcast affiliates. But the inclusion of Gateway Pundit has raised concerns that the Trump administration, which has called the news media \u201cthe opposition party,\u2019\u2019 is favoring outlets more sympathetic to its views.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"329\" data-total-count=\"2206\">On Monday, some journalists complained after Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-reporter-questions.html\">took questions at his news conference</a> only from a local broadcast journalist and a reporter from The Daily Caller, a conservative news site. Neither reporter asked about one of the day\u2019s top stories, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html\">the status of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser</a>, Michael T.

Last month, the site drew criticism for disseminating <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/sick-wapo-reporter-caught-sneaking-photos-rex-tillersons-notes-senate-hearing-video/\">a false report</a> that a Washington Post journalist had photographed the written notes of Secretary of State Rex W.

When you are trying to get new information out there as quickly as possible, occasionally you\u2019ll get something wrong and have to fix it. That\u2019s how media works right now.\u201d He said that Gateway Pundit had \u201cbroken dozens and dozens more factual stories\u201d but did not offer an example when asked for one.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"247\" data-total-count=\"3412\">Mr. Wintrich described himself as a Trump supporter and Goldwater conservative who enjoys \u201csimultaneously trolling both progressives and evangelical conservatives.\u201d He said his aim was \u201cto provide fair coverage from the conservative side.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"3784\">On Twitter on Monday, Mr. Wintrich posted a photograph of himself standing behind the White House press room lectern, a White House pass slung around his neck. The post from Mr. Hoft included the hashtag #pepe and an accompanying Pepe emoji, a reference to Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that has been <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-pepe-the-frog-hate-symbol-20161011-snap-htmlstory.html\">repurposed as a symbol </a>by white supremacy and anti-Semitic groups.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"201\" data-total-count=\"3985\">Mr. Wintrich said the inclusion of the Pepe icon was not meant as anti-Semitic. \u201cMy grandfather is Jewish, he fought against the Germans, escaped through the Polish underground,\u201d Mr. Wintrich said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on February 14, 2017, on Page A18 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: A Pro-Trump Blog Gains White House Credentials. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/donald-trump-white-house\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>White House Grants Press Credentials to a Pro-Trump Blog - The New York Times</title>"]},

Schwarzman.\" class=\"meta-per\">Stephen A. Schwarzman</a> had another birthday party.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"346\" data-total-count=\"399\">The celebration for his 70th birthday at his Palm Beach, Fla., home over the weekend included live camels, trapeze artists and a performance by Gwen Stefani. Some reports speculated the party cost as much as $20 million, a price tag that insiders say is ridiculously inflated, but clearly the event fell in the category of over-the-top expensive.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"344\" data-total-count=\"743\">Normally, a birthday party for a boldface name wouldn\u2019t warrant a sentence outside the gossip pages. But Mr. Schwarzman is the billionaire co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/the-blackstone-group?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More information about The Blackstone Group\" class=\"meta-org\">the Blackstone Group</a> as well as President Trump\u2019s latest BFF as the chairman of the president\u2019s strategic policy forum \u2014 and his last birthday bash turned into a cultural flash point.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"996\">You might recall that, a decade ago, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 60th birthday party \u2014 reportedly for some $5 million at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan \u2014 spun into a yearslong existential crisis on Wall Street about the evils of conspicuous consumption.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"476\" data-total-count=\"1472\">On Wall Street and in the media, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 2007 party was treated as a five-alarm fire. Many media outlets gawked at it prominently, with an implicit tsk, tsk. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/11/the-birthday-party-2\">The New Yorker declared</a> that it had turned Mr. Schwarzman into <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about private equity.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">private equity</a>\u2019s \u201cdesignated villain.\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced what became known as the Blackstone Bill to end the tax treatment of carried interest, though industry opposition managed to shoot it down.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"27\" data-total-count=\"1499\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Oh, how times have changed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"219\" data-total-count=\"1718\">In the age of Mr. Trump and his famed golden penthouse, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s party has largely been ignored except for a bit of chattering by <a href=\"http://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/parties/news/a9556/steve-schwarzman-birthday-party/\">Town &amp; Country</a> and sniping among the schadenfreude-loving Acela Corridor Crowd.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"382\" data-total-count=\"2100\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Perhaps Mr. Trump has normalized conspicuous consumption. On Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, there were a few smuggled snapshots of the Schwarzman party passed around, but not much in the way of great viral outcry. A <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/local/anti-trump-protesters-don-get-near-schwarzman-party/9qO45G2K4psdtIVarHeETJ/\">small band of protesters </a>who tried to picket the party on Saturday night did not get anywhere close to it, nor was there much media pickup on the group\u2019s message.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"180\" data-total-count=\"2280\">The collective yawn may say something larger about the shifts in the way parts of the country think about great wealth \u2014 and perhaps how they have always thought about big money.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"2652\">Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the nominations of his cabinet of billionaires may draw ire from his critics, but the people who elected him \u2014 who draw largely from the middle and lower classes \u2014 appear nonplused by his, and other people\u2019s, showy displays of wealth. Indeed, judging by various polls, much of the country aspires to live like Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"527\" data-total-count=\"3179\">While Mr. Trump himself did not attend the party, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, did. So did others from the administration, including Elaine L. Chao, the transportation secretary; Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary. Other guests included everyone from the prominent financier Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the fashion designer Donatella Versace to Susan George, executive director of the Inner-City Scholarship Fund in New York.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"550\" data-total-count=\"3729\">People who were there said that the tennis courts had been covered with Asian-themed staging, and that Mr. Schwarzman was presented an oversize cake that looked like an Asian temple. But even a generous tally of all the most lavish components couldn\u2019t get you anywhere within shouting distance of $20 million: Even if, theoretically, Gwen Stefani had charged the $1 million that Rod Stewart was said to have charged at Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 60th (and she didn\u2019t; the figure was substantially lower), it would take 20 of her to get to that price tag.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"366\" data-total-count=\"4095\">A friend of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s said that one of the lessons from the 60th birthday\u2019s blowback was he was never going to satisfy his critics, and that he had to live his life on his own terms. At age 70, said the friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to express candid views, Mr. Schwarzman has given a lot back and does not need to placate everyone.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"587\" data-total-count=\"4682\">In truth, Mr. Schwarzman has become perhaps the most successful financier on Wall Street over the past decade, growing Blackstone to become the pre-eminent asset manager in the country, pulling far ahead of his private-equity rivals and turning his firm into one of the largest real estate investors in the world. And his generosity has extended to several nine-figure donations \u2014 that\u2019s more than $100 million each \u2014 to Yale, the New York Public Library and a scholarship program modeled after the Rhodes for students from the United States to attend Tsinghua University in China.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"412\" data-total-count=\"5094\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Last week, responding to scholarship recipients\u2019 criticism over his decision to help Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote in a letter: \u201cI regret that some scholars have reservations about my following this approach with the new administration in Washington. In life, you\u2019ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"457\" data-total-count=\"5551\">The populist, anti-Wall Street sentiment that was so loud after the financial crisis found its voice last year in the campaign of Bernie Sanders \u2014 and to some degree, ironically, in Mr. Trump\u2019s. Whatever animus exists against fat cats has been muted among Mr. Trump\u2019s red-state voters, at least temporarily, as long as he follows though on his promise to create jobs. It\u2019s a point that many of us in the media \u2014 myself included \u2014 largely missed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"266\" data-total-count=\"5817\">Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election may speak volumes about how large parts of the country view big business today, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to lower taxes and deregulate parts of Wall Street. And Mr. Schwarzman is at the center of many of those efforts.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"223\" data-total-count=\"6040\">Back in 2012, NPR <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/01/14/145213421/the-income-gap-unfair-or-are-we-just-jealous\">ran an article</a> which clearly did not get the attention it deserved, especially given what it portended for the subsequent election cycle. The headline: \u201cThe Income Gap: Unfair, Or Are We Just Jealous?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

A significant overhaul of the print newspaper resulted in the elimination of some sections, including Greater New York, and the consolidation of others.

The announcement surprised and saddened many in the newsroom, where Ms. Blumenstein had been viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Baker.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"224\" data-total-count=\"2901\">At Monday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Baker answered questions about The Journal\u2019s strategy going forward and acknowledged that the paper had to address concerns about diversity and offer more opportunities for women in the newsroom.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"258\" data-total-count=\"3159\">But the issue of covering Mr. Trump was front and center, after an episode two weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/wall-street-journal-editor-stop-calling-the-travel-ban-count\">when Mr. Baker sent a note</a> instructing editors to avoid the phrase \u201cseven majority Muslim countries\u201d when writing about Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

There was unease in the newsroom after Mr. Baker wrote a <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/11/the-law-of-movies-now-applies-to-world-politics-nobody-knows-anything/\">column in The Spectator</a>, a conservative British magazine, about Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. During the meeting on Monday, Mr. Baker, in answer to a question about the column, admitted that he probably should have resisted the temptation to write it, according to some of the people who participated.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"322\" data-total-count=\"4467\">The Journal\u2019s coverage has also drawn criticism from outside. In late November, after Mr. Trump falsely claimed on Twitter that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/802972944532209664?lang=en\">millions of people</a>\u201d had voted illegally, the paper was <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wall-street-journal-donald-trump_us_583c8d21e4b0860d6115e671\">derided online</a> for printing a front-page headline that parroted Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion without pointing out that it was inaccurate.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"4717\">In a statement at the time, a spokeswoman for The Journal said, \u201cWe evaluate all statements by President-elect Trump for their news value and then subject them to the tough, thorough and impartial reporting we bring to all issues we report upon.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"330\" data-total-count=\"5047\">Disturbed by the paper\u2019s coverage, a number of journalists at The Journal began communicating by email about their concerns. The internal email chain, a portion of which was obtained by The Times, included general concerns about how articles on the new administration were being framed and objections to certain wording choices.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"114\" data-total-count=\"5161\">Some on the email chain proposed writing a letter to top management or creating a \u201cno euphemisms\u201d style guide.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"163\" data-total-count=\"5324\">\u201cWe need to be able to cover the new administration with the probing, aggressiveness and authority that our readers deserve and pay for,\u201d one journalist wrote.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"473\" data-total-count=\"5797\">It is an especially sensitive time for journalists, particularly in the mainstream news media, and journalists in many newsrooms are on edge. Relentless cost-cutting has ravaged news organizations that have yet to find ways to offset steep declines in print advertising and circulation. Against this backdrop, Mr. Trump and his aides have vilified the news media, calling it the \u201copposition party\u201d and singling out certain organizations as purveyors of \u201cfake news.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"430\" data-total-count=\"6227\">There are some bright spots at The Journal. In an earnings call last week, Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corporation, said The Journal, like other publications, had benefited from interest in the election, adding more than 110,000 digital subscriptions in the quarter. The Journal now has more than one million digital subscribers, representing more than 50 percent of the publication\u2019s total subscribers, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"6487\">Still, total advertising revenue at Dow Jones, a subsidiary of News Corporation, declined about 20 percent in the last quarter. Mr. Baker said on Monday that about 200 people had taken buyouts or been laid off, but that there were no plans for further layoffs.</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on February 14, 2017, on Page B2 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: Wall Street Journal Editor Defends Coverage of Trump. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Top Wall Street Journal Editor Defends Trump Coverage - The New York Times</title>"]},

Smith, A.I.G.\u2019s former chief financial officer, took responsibility for the two transactions at issue in the case. They acknowledged that the transactions, which had improved A.I.G.\u2019s reported loss reserves and underwriting income, resulted in inaccurate portrayals of those aspects of the company\u2019s financial condition to investors.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"352\" data-total-count=\"1531\">But the statements, the product of weeks of negotiations with the attorney general\u2019s office, did not use the word fraud, and did not include any explicit admission of wrongdoing.

During a long debate over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-treasury-confirmation-hearing.html\">Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s credentials</a>, Democrats argued that his experience on Wall Street exemplified corporate malpractice that led to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"395\" data-total-count=\"1032\">The new Treasury secretary will have little time to celebrate. He will be under pressure to help finalize the Trump administration\u2019s tax plan, accelerate the rollback regulations and raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit. The administration has said it will release a comprehensive plan to rewrite the tax code in the coming weeks, and it will have to deal with the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/national_debt_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about the national debt.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">debt ceiling</a> next month.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"246\" data-total-count=\"1278\">While Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s financial acumen has been praised by Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress, Democrats have argued forcefully that he is not up to the job.

The Democrats on the committee twice boycotted a vote on his confirmation, leading Republicans to breach protocol and push Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s vote to the full Senate on their own.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"311\" data-total-count=\"3085\">Just one Democrat, Senator of Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broke with his party and supported Mr. Mnuchin. In a sign of the backlash that Democrats will face for siding with any part of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee warned that Mr. Manchin\u2019s vote would not go unnoticed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"197\" data-total-count=\"3282\">\u201cWe will ensure that Joe Manchin hears from his West Virginia constituents who disapprove of his voting with Wall Street against working families,\u201d the group said in a statement after the vote.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"68\" data-total-count=\"3350\">For Republicans, the resistance was chalked up to political theater.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"201\" data-total-count=\"3551\">On Monday, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, accused Democrats of making Mr. Mnuchin a political pawn and described their concerns as a stall tactic.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"3889\">\u201cUnder any objective standard, Mr. Mnuchin has ample experience, credentials and qualifications for this important position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cMy colleagues have done all they can under the rules \u2014 even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate \u2014 in order to delay his confirmation.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"518\" data-total-count=\"4407\" id=\"story-continues-4\">While Mr. Mnuchin struggled to show fluency with some aspects of the job during his confirmation hearing, Republicans and Democrats generally agreed that he was well versed on economic issues. He also struck a more moderate tone than Mr. Trump on issues such as trade and dealing with China. And Mr. Mnuchin left some experts dumbfounded after suggesting that \u201cthere would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class\u201d \u2014 a promise that appears to be at odds with plans presented by Mr. Trump and House Republicans.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"335\" data-total-count=\"4742\">Mr. Mnuchin was not the only member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet to be confirmed on Monday night. The Senate also voted in favor of David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. A holdover from the Obama administration, Dr. Shulkin is currently the department\u2019s under secretary of health and was approved by a unanimous vote.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"281\" data-total-count=\"5023\">Mr. Mnuchin was the latest member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet to edge through the confirmation process on a largely party-line vote. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/politics/tom-price-health-and-human-services.html\">Tom Price was approved</a> as secretary of health and human services and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary-confirmed.html\">Betsy DeVos narrowly won confirmation</a> to lead the Education Department.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"5335\">Things could become more complicated on Thursday, however, when Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary, faces a committee hearing. Several Republicans on the committee have declined to support Mr. Puzder, a fast-food chain executive who critics say promotes policies that are harmful to workers.</p>", "<p><em>Follow The New York Times\u2019s politics and Washington coverage on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytpolitics\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/nytpolitics\">Twitter</a>, and sign up for the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics/\">First Draft politics newsletter</a>.</em></p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on February 14, 2017, on Page A19 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: Mnuchin Is Confirmed Mostly Along Party Lines. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/donald-trump-white-house\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Steven Mnuchin Is Confirmed as Treasury Secretary - The New York Times</title>"]},

At least part of the attraction, analysts said, was the area\u2019s lightly unionized labor force \u2014 giving the company more leverage over the union at its main operations outside Seattle.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"164\" data-total-count=\"502\">Now that equation is being put to the test.

Mr. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-boeing.html\">criticized Boeing</a> over the cost of a new <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/presidents_and_presidency_us/air_force_one/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about Air Force One.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Air Force One</a> project, but it is also a major employer and exporter, as well as a military contractor \u2014 one that Mr. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/business/trump-lockheed-boeing-jet-costs.html\">pitted against Lockheed Martin</a> in seeking price savings on fighter jets.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"283\" data-total-count=\"1589\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Boeing has roughly 7,500 workers in South Carolina, primarily in North Charleston and Ladson, of whom a little over 3,000 are eligible for the union. There are about 30,000 unionized workers at its facilities in the Puget Sound area, where it turns out other aircraft models as well.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"230\" data-total-count=\"1819\">The machinists made a similar union push here nearly two years ago, but called off a vote a several days before the scheduled election, complaining of a deluge of misinformation from management and pressure from local politicians.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"525\" data-total-count=\"2344\">Two Boeing officials, who would not speak for attribution, expressed confidence that the company would turn back the unionization effort and suggested that the union was racing to act before Mr. Trump appoints two members to <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/board/members-nlrb-1935\">vacant seats</a> on the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections, and overturns its Democratic majority. If the union were to win, Boeing would have to file any objections to a regional official of the agency within days, with any subsequent appeal going to the board in Washington.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"144\" data-total-count=\"2488\">Mike Evans, the machinists\u2019 lead organizer in South Carolina, rejected that suggestion, saying the union believes it has the votes to prevail.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"263\" data-total-count=\"2751\">\u201cIf we weren\u2019t ready, we\u2019d still be down here sharing information, getting up the facts of the benefits of collective bargaining,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve reached that and have a significant amount of support. That\u2019s what dictates, \u2018Why now?\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"266\" data-total-count=\"3017\">Under rules overseen by the labor board, unions can call an election once at least 30 percent of eligible workers have signed up to authorize one, but the unions typically wait until they have a substantially higher level of support to improve their odds of success.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"3267\">The machinists may also benefit from two years\u2019 worth of accumulated frustrations among workers. Mr. Evans said workers felt their evaluations were frequently arbitrary, an issue that the company promised to address before the first scheduled vote.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"296\" data-total-count=\"3563\">\u201cWhatever changes were promised it\u2019s been more of the same,\u201d AJ Russo, a production coordinator at the Boeing plant in North Charleston, said in an interview after a pro-union rally Monday, at which he spoke. How workers are treated \u201cdepends on where you\u2019re standing, what day it is.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"444\" data-total-count=\"4007\" id=\"story-continues-4\">The issue is all the more salient because the company recently announced it would undergo a round of job reductions that will affect its South Carolina operations amid intense competition from its chief rival, Airbus. Management has not ruled out involuntary layoffs if the company is unable to hit its goal for cost savings. While the cuts discussed so far would not affect union-eligible workers, they are a source of anxiety, Mr. Evans said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"337\" data-total-count=\"4344\">In addition to making the evaluation and layoff process fairer in the eyes of workers, a union could bargain for higher wages. The average wage for unionized Boeing workers in Washington State is about $31 per hour, versus about $23 per hour for union-eligible workers in South Carolina, according to data from the company and the union.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"310\" data-total-count=\"4654\">Boeing has said the difference is driven partly by the local cost of living and labor market conditions, and partly by the longer average tenure of workers in Washington. The union says pay tops out at a certain point, making additional tenure relevant only to issues like benefits and job security, not wages.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"268\" data-total-count=\"4922\">Even if the union prevailed, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily restore the leverage it enjoyed before the Dreamliner plant opened here. South Carolina is a \u201cright to work\u201d state, meaning workers do not have to join the union or pay union fees as a condition of employment.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"164\" data-total-count=\"5086\">According to Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., this was an important consideration in Boeing\u2019s decision to locate here.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"252\" data-total-count=\"5338\">\u201cIf you have just enough folks who will cross the picket lines, you can still get certification and testing work done,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said, alluding to the possibility of a strike. \u201cThat can make a difference in keeping some revenue coming in.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

Under N.L.R.B. rules enacted later that year, companies are required to hand over the names of union-eligible workers earlier in the election process.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"380\" data-total-count=\"6865\">Still, the campaign faces considerable obstacles. A local business group tied to the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, of which Boeing is a member, has been running advertisements on local television, including one depicting a thuggish casino boss urging people to roll dice at a craps table. The message is that the union wants workers to gamble away what they already have.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"7203\">Boeing implies that a vote to unionize would mean inserting the union into the relationship between workers and managers, something the union says is false. Organizers say that union stewards would be available when workers felt they had been mistreated, but that otherwise workers would be left to interact with managers as they saw fit.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"167\" data-total-count=\"7370\">The company has also sought to play up a split between the union and the South Carolina workers by invoking the union\u2019s efforts to preserve production in Washington.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"274\" data-total-count=\"7644\">\u201cWe have not forgotten the I.A.M.\u2019s history in South Carolina, including their repeated insults regarding our teammates\u2019 abilities,\u201d said Joan Robinson-Berry, the general manager of Boeing South Carolina, <a href=\"http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2017-01-20-Boeing-Responds-to-IAM-Filing-Second-Petition-to-Unionize-Boeing-South-Carolina\">in a statement</a> after the union vote was announced in January.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"108\" data-total-count=\"7752\">And then there is the general challenge of South Carolina\u2019s political culture, famously hostile to unions.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"329\" data-total-count=\"8081\">\u201cI taught undergrads here at the university for many years,\u201d said Hoyt N.

A thief got her online banking user name and password, installed Chase\u2019s mobile app on his or her phone, and used it to withdraw cash. Unlike most cardless systems, Chase\u2019s does not require customers to enter their four-digit PIN at the cash machine.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"2186\">Chase refunded the customer\u2019s lost money and immediately made security changes. \u201cWe\u2019ve put safeguards in place to protect our customers,\u201d said Michael Fusco, a Chase spokesman.

Thanks to multiple layers of security, there has been no fraud so far, said Thomas P. Ormseth, a senior vice president at the bank. (\u201cKnock on wood,\u201d he added.)</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"93\" data-total-count=\"2757\">How the mobile systems work varies from bank to bank \u2014 and sometimes, even within one bank.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"3069\">Most of the major banks are using a technology called near-field communications (known as N.F.C.), which enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances. <a href=\"https://www.nfcworld.com/nfc-phones-list/\">Modern smartphones</a> usually contain an N.F.C. chip, which is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/technology/personaltech/in-the-race-to-pay-mobile-wallets-win.html\">used for many mobile payment systems</a>, including Apple Pay and Android Pay.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"277\" data-total-count=\"3346\">At Bank of America, customers with compatible phones and a digital wallet app can <a href=\"http://promo.bankofamerica.com/cardlessatm/\">tap their phone on the cash machine\u2019s wireless pad</a> to authenticate their identity. From there, customers enter their personal identification numbers and carry out transactions in the usual way.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"411\" data-total-count=\"3757\">Wells Fargo is also testing N.F.C. and adding the hardware it requires to all of its cash machines. But in the meantime, it has a simpler approach: one-time access codes. Customers can log in to Wells Fargo\u2019s mobile app and request one, which is good for 30 minutes. At the 900 Wells Fargo A.T.M.s that are set up to accept the codes so far, the customer types in the code and then their PIN to withdraw cash.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"479\" data-total-count=\"4236\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Mobile A.T.M. transactions are usually at least a little bit faster than traditional ones, banks say \u2014 sometimes significantly so. Wintrust\u2019s system, which lets customers set up their withdrawal in advance on their phone and simply <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/fashion/qr-codes-provide-information-when-scanned.html\">scan a QR (quick response) code</a> when they get to the machine to get their cash, cut its average transaction time to about 10 seconds from 45, Mr. Ormseth said. Around 17 percent of the bank\u2019s customers have used the technology at least once.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"133\" data-total-count=\"4369\">Some banks have gone further and let customers ditch even their phones.

(The system handled more than 700 million transactions without any reported fraud, <a href=\"http://www.fujitsu.com/global/Images/cs-banco-bradesco-en.pdf\">according to Fujitsu</a>, which built the technology.) Banks in <a href=\"https://www.asmag.com/showpost/18642.aspx\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://findbiometrics.com/indian-biometric-atm-306137/\">India</a> and elsewhere have used fingerprints for authentication.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"5120\">Citibank experimented two years ago with an iris-scanning A.T.M., <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/citigroup-is-testing-out-new-eye-scanning-atm/\">showing off a prototype</a> at a trade show. The reaction was everything the bank had hoped for: \u201cPeople\u2019s jaws dropped,\u201d said Mark Gilder, Citibank\u2019s director of A.T.M. distribution in the United States. \u201cThey thought it was magical. You just had to look at the machine, and money would come out.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"267\" data-total-count=\"5387\">Then reality set in. A compromised bank card can be reissued. If a hacker figures out <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/07/reverse-engineering-iris-scans/\">how to imitate someone\u2019s eyeball</a> \u2014 which has been done in laboratory settings \u2014 it can\u2019t be replaced. For that and other reasons, Citibank shelved its iris scanner, for now.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"62\" data-total-count=\"5449\">It is also taking a wait-and-see approach to cardless A.T.M.s.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"203\" data-total-count=\"5652\">\u201cWe want to be ready when people no longer carry cards and leave their wallets at home, but that timeline is developing more slowly than perhaps we thought it would a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Gilder said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"44\" data-total-count=\"5696\">This year, though, could be a tipping point.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"244\" data-total-count=\"5940\">About 2.5 percent of the 425,000 A.T.M.s in the country are currently set up for cardless access, according to an estimate from <a href=\"http://www.croneconsulting.com/\">Crone Consulting</a>, which researches the payments industry. By the fall, it expects that number to rise to 25 percent.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"6291\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/business/dealbook/why-we-are-still-reaching-for-wallets-not-phones-at-the-checkout.html\">As with mobile wallets</a>, technical hurdles may hamper customer enthusiasm.

From a high above $100 a barrel earlier that year, prices fell below $30 a barrel in early 2016 before <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/09/business/energy-environment/oil-prices.html\">recovering modestly</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"279\" data-total-count=\"1402\">That played havoc with the government budgets of major oil producers, pushing even Saudi Arabia \u2014 OPEC\u2019s biggest member by oil output \u2014 to borrow large sums in financial markets and to risk antagonizing its citizens by raising energy prices and cutting government salaries.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"131\" data-total-count=\"1533\">What followed was a year of sometimes cliff-edge negotiations to reach the deal that was eventually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/international/opec-energy-oil-saudi-iran.html\">announced in Vienna on Nov</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/international/opec-energy-oil-saudi-iran.html\">.</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/international/opec-energy-oil-saudi-iran.html\"> 30</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"262\" data-total-count=\"1795\">Had the producers not agreed, prices could have fallen further. \u201cPeople got pretty close to the abyss and looked down, and it was pretty deep,\u201d Daniel Yergin, an oil historian, said in an interview. \u201cAs a consequence they stepped back and did something.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"190\" data-total-count=\"1985\">Russia\u2019s shift to looking for production curbs was crucial, OPEC officials say.

OPEC says the figures are based on secondary sources, rather than on data from the members themselves, and that the figures largely confirm data published on Friday by the International Energy Agency in Paris.

Saudi Arabia cut its output by more than it had initially promised, to less than 10 million barrels per day.

Most analysts think they will stay relatively close to the agreed targets for the next few months.

We took a lot of care to describe the Islamic State as a terrorist group that acted in the name of Islam.

I led the State Department\u2019s agency that sought to counter the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda efforts and saw this firsthand. More than 80 percent of the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda is in Arabic. Russian is the second-most-used language, while English and French are tied for third. The United States is not the Islamic State\u2019s main audience. We have always been the distant enemy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"536\" data-total-count=\"3423\">So, jettison \u201cviolent extremism,\u201d but let our Arab allies know that \u201cradical Islam\u201d or \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d refers only to the tiny fraction of the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims who have embraced violence. Tell them we need their help both on the military battlefield and in the information and intelligence space. And be specific: \u201cWe are fighting the Islamic State and Al Qaeda and their <em>radical Islamic </em>imitators like Boko Haram.\u201d After all, \u201cradical Islam\u201d is only a shade less vague than \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"493\" data-total-count=\"3916\">The Islamic State is not just a terrorist group, it is an idea. Its rallying cry is that the West is hostile to Islam and that every good Muslim has a duty to join the caliphate. Most of the group\u2019s propaganda was not violent at all. I saw thousands of tweets about how beautiful the caliphate was. There were videos of kids on Ferris wheels and jihadi fighters distributing cotton candy. I remember one tweet showing a shiny apple and the words, in Arabic, \u201cThe caliphate is bountiful.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"400\" data-total-count=\"4316\">It is not up to us to say what is Islamic and what is not. Only the voices of mainstream Muslims and independent clerics in Muslim countries can create a narrative that refutes the Islamic State\u2019s and offers a more positive alternative. A tweet from the United States government saying the Islamic State is a distortion of Islam is not going to hurt the group. Instead, it will help its recruiting.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"667\" data-total-count=\"4983\">That is why the Trump administration\u2019s executive order on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations is deeply counterproductive in the fight against Islamic extremism. It has already been reported that the Islamic State has called it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/829349865012490241\">\u201cthe blessed ban\u201d</a> because it supports the Islamic State\u2019s position that America hates Islam. The clause in the order that gives Christians preferential treatment will be seen as confirming the Islamic State\u2019s apocalyptic narrative that Islam is in a fight to the death against the Christian crusaders. The images of Muslim visitors being turned away at American airports will only inflame those who seek to do us harm.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"490\" data-total-count=\"5473\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Two years ago, just before Ramadan, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, said: Don\u2019t bother coming to the caliphate, but commit acts of violence against the enemy wherever you are. The call was no longer religious or ideological \u2014 what the group sought to do was exploit vulnerability. Mr. Adnani was, in effect, saying, \u201cWhatever angers you \u2014 whether it\u2019s your boss or your neighbors or the police \u2014 commit acts of violence in the Islamic State\u2019s name.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"271\" data-total-count=\"5744\">Thus, the black flag of the Islamic State became a flag of convenience for any complaint. Now the travel ban, despite being blocked by the courts, has given the group ammunition to weaponize grievance here in America. President Trump may become its No. 1 recruiting tool.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"413\" data-total-count=\"6157\">The Islamic State will go away, but violent extremism will not. The way to defeat radical Islamic extremism is to help our Islamic allies and promote the voices of mainstream Islam that reject everything the Islamic State does and stands for. Defeating the Islamic State on the military battlefield is only temporary.

No one in the Obama administration could or did.

We took a lot of care to describe the Islamic State as a terrorist group that acted in the name of Islam. Sure, behind the scenes, our allies understood better than anyone that the Islamic State was a radical perversion of Islam, that it held a dark appeal to a minority of Sunni Muslims, but it didn\u2019t help to call them radical Islamic terrorists.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"228\" data-total-count=\"1842\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Now the Trump administration wants to toss out the term \u201cviolent extremism\u201d and the rubric we used to fight it. Instead, they are <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO\">renaming</a> it \u201ccountering Islamic extremism,\u201d or \u201ccountering radical Islamic extremism.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"424\" data-total-count=\"2266\">Fine. Abandon the name, but let\u2019s not abandon the strategy. First, let\u2019s acknowledge that it\u2019s working. The Islamic State as a military force, much less as a caliphate, is on the ropes in Iraq and Syria. The group has not had a military victory in a year and a half. The flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria is down by 90 percent, according to the Defense Department. The liberation of Mosul is on the horizon.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\">Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

I led the State Department\u2019s agency that sought to counter the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda efforts and saw this firsthand. More than 80 percent of the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda is in Arabic. Russian is the second-most-used language, while English and French are tied for third. The United States is not the Islamic State\u2019s main audience. We have always been the distant enemy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"536\" data-total-count=\"3423\">So, jettison \u201cviolent extremism,\u201d but let our Arab allies know that \u201cradical Islam\u201d or \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d refers only to the tiny fraction of the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims who have embraced violence. Tell them we need their help both on the military battlefield and in the information and intelligence space. And be specific: \u201cWe are fighting the Islamic State and Al Qaeda and their <em>radical Islamic </em>imitators like Boko Haram.\u201d After all, \u201cradical Islam\u201d is only a shade less vague than \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"493\" data-total-count=\"3916\">The Islamic State is not just a terrorist group, it is an idea. Its rallying cry is that the West is hostile to Islam and that every good Muslim has a duty to join the caliphate. Most of the group\u2019s propaganda was not violent at all. I saw thousands of tweets about how beautiful the caliphate was. There were videos of kids on Ferris wheels and jihadi fighters distributing cotton candy. I remember one tweet showing a shiny apple and the words, in Arabic, \u201cThe caliphate is bountiful.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"400\" data-total-count=\"4316\">It is not up to us to say what is Islamic and what is not. Only the voices of mainstream Muslims and independent clerics in Muslim countries can create a narrative that refutes the Islamic State\u2019s and offers a more positive alternative. A tweet from the United States government saying the Islamic State is a distortion of Islam is not going to hurt the group. Instead, it will help its recruiting.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"667\" data-total-count=\"4983\">That is why the Trump administration\u2019s executive order on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations is deeply counterproductive in the fight against Islamic extremism. It has already been reported that the Islamic State has called it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/829349865012490241\">\u201cthe blessed ban\u201d</a> because it supports the Islamic State\u2019s position that America hates Islam. The clause in the order that gives Christians preferential treatment will be seen as confirming the Islamic State\u2019s apocalyptic narrative that Islam is in a fight to the death against the Christian crusaders. The images of Muslim visitors being turned away at American airports will only inflame those who seek to do us harm.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"490\" data-total-count=\"5473\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Two years ago, just before Ramadan, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, said: Don\u2019t bother coming to the caliphate, but commit acts of violence against the enemy wherever you are. The call was no longer religious or ideological \u2014 what the group sought to do was exploit vulnerability. Mr. Adnani was, in effect, saying, \u201cWhatever angers you \u2014 whether it\u2019s your boss or your neighbors or the police \u2014 commit acts of violence in the Islamic State\u2019s name.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"271\" data-total-count=\"5744\">Thus, the black flag of the Islamic State became a flag of convenience for any complaint. Now the travel ban, despite being blocked by the courts, has given the group ammunition to weaponize grievance here in America. President Trump may become its No. 1 recruiting tool.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"413\" data-total-count=\"6157\">The Islamic State will go away, but violent extremism will not. The way to defeat radical Islamic extremism is to help our Islamic allies and promote the voices of mainstream Islam that reject everything the Islamic State does and stands for. Defeating the Islamic State on the military battlefield is only temporary. Violent extremism \u2014 or whatever you call it \u2014 must be defeated on the battlefield of ideas.</p>", "<p>Richard Stengel is a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School.</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this op-ed appears in print on February 13, 2017, on Page A23 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: Call It What You Want.

What were your early years like?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"275\" data-total-count=\"454\"><strong>A.</strong> I\u2019m originally from Orange County, Calif. My parents were in the horse business, and we had racehorses growing up. But I was much more of a city kid, and not that much into horses. From a young age, I was a very serious dancer, doing ballet and jazz and everything else.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"430\" data-total-count=\"884\">I was much more of my grandmother\u2019s child. She grew up in Los Angeles, her parents were in the film industry and she ran a retail store. When I was young, I would stay with her and work at her store. I loved the cash register, dressing the mannequins, and I remember learning how to sell when I was about 9. I would act nonchalant and just express my opinion, and people believed me. I was very entrepreneurial from a young age.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"256\" data-total-count=\"1140\">I also didn\u2019t have a traditional education. Because of dance, I was doing independent study by eighth grade. And I initially thought I wanted to be a film producer. So my plan was to go to Santa Monica College and then transfer to U.S.C. for film school.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"239\" data-total-count=\"1379\" id=\"story-continues-2\">I had started an internship the summer before at Touchstone Pictures. But on the first day at S.M.C., I showed up early to find parking. I drove around and around and around and couldn\u2019t find a spot. And so I decided, this is not for me.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"240\" data-total-count=\"1619\">I called Touchstone and said, \u201cI\u2019m available Monday through Friday, 9 to 5, if you\u2019ll have me.\u201d I worked for this producer every single day for free, and soon after she hired me as her assistant.

She treated us like adults and taught us how to be professional and respectful. We would constantly have directors or producers coming to watch us to hire us for various events or movies, like \u201cAustin Powers.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"239\" data-total-count=\"2227\">It was about always doing your best and putting your best foot forward. You never know where an opportunity can come from. She helped shape who I am today, particularly being thick-skinned, because you go to auditions and you get rejected.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"192\" data-total-count=\"2419\">But I don\u2019t even think of it as rejection, because of her.

That gives me a lot of insight into exactly what they care about.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"290\" data-total-count=\"4375\">And I look for people who have created their own experience. So maybe you worked for a fashion brand but on the side you created your own blog dedicated to home d\u00e9cor, or you learned about a specific industry, or you took on an additional job or internship just to learn about a new field.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"95\" data-total-count=\"4470\"><strong>And what kinds of answers are you listening for to the question about what makes it a good day?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"181\" data-total-count=\"4651\">It depends on the job, but it\u2019s typically when there has been some sort of accomplishment or efficiency created, like, \u201cI saved X amount of money by doing something this way.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"4915\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Or if I\u2019m interviewing for my assistant position, I want to hear someone talk about making every meeting run on schedule and being able to fit everyone in.

With his frequent firsthand experience as a guide, he started a company this year to help make moving less of a chore.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"311\" data-total-count=\"553\">His company, called <a href=\"https://hellomoved.com/\">Moved</a>, is one of several that hope to shake up the nearly $17 billion moving industry with new technology and on-demand services. Meanwhile, traditional moving companies are coming up with their own innovations as more consumers prefer to conduct their business on computers and smartphones.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"795\">Through a mobile app that incorporates chat features, Moved can help customers through a laundry list of responsibilities: selling furniture, donating goods, ordering boxes, changing addresses and finding packing, moving and storage services.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"307\" data-total-count=\"1102\">Moved\u2019s \u201cconcierge\u201d services \u2014 locating and coordinating with service providers \u2014 are free; customers pay for what they use. Moved makes money through referral fees from its partners, which it says are vetted. All of the moving companies it works with are licensed and insured, Mr. Pittenger said.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"349\" data-total-count=\"1451\" id=\"story-continues-2\">\u201cWe\u2019re the experience layer in between consumer and service provider, so consumers don\u2019t have to spend the time researching and coordinating,\u201d said Mr. Pittenger, 27, the chief operating officer of Moved, which is based in New York. \u201cWhen they are busy at work and going about their day, moving tasks are getting done in the background.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"410\" data-total-count=\"1861\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Mr. Pittenger is part of a younger generation who are renting and living with roommates rather than purchasing homes; they move more often as a result. Adults ages 18 to 34 have the highest rate of migration, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/acs/acs-31.pdf\">according to the United States Census Bureau</a>. While they made up about 34 percent of the total population of the United States from 2007 to 2012, they accounted for over 43 percent of people who moved.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"2057\">After a slump during the recession, the industry as a whole has returned to growth, and revenue is expected to continue to grow for the next five years, according to IBISWorld, a research company.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"348\" data-total-count=\"2405\">\u201cI think people are less stuck in the homeowner mentality,\u201d said Cameron Doody, a founder of <a href=\"https://getbellhops.com/\">Bellhops</a>, a company in Chattanooga, Tenn., that provides moving services. People are \u201cvaluing mobility more than ever before. We\u2019re seeing a big shift in people that are holding out longer to buy homes for the flexibility of being able to rent.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"139\" data-total-count=\"2544\">Mr. Doody, 30, who has moved five times in the last four years, focuses on a type of mover he thinks the larger companies have left behind.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"270\" data-total-count=\"2814\">\u201cTraditionally, customers have been bucketed into two categories,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re either the do-it-yourselfer, where you\u2019re renting a truck and begging your friends to help you, or you go to professional moving companies,\u201d frequently for a large home move.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"350\" data-total-count=\"3164\">As Mr. Doody sees it, the frequent do-it-yourself mover would hire a professional if it weren\u2019t so costly. Bellhops uses algorithms to make small-scale moves \u2014 typically involving local moves of apartments and small homes \u2014 more affordable, he said. A typical two-bedroom apartment move with Bellhops costs under $400, according to the company.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"155\" data-total-count=\"3319\">Bellhops\u2019 moving services are available in Kansas City, Mo.; Chapel Hill, N.C.; Athens, Ga.; and about 50 other towns and cities with major universities.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"352\" data-total-count=\"3671\">Mr. Doody\u2019s company works with school organizations to find students to work as movers. The company performs background checks on them through a third party. Customers receive a biography of their \u201cbellhop\u201d when they schedule a move.

Trump, while he was still running the Trump Organization, bailed out his son, who was then facing payment of a $3.65 million bank loan to Titan Atlas.

Last month, the South Carolina Health and Environmental Control Department sent a letter to Mr. Cohen, demanding information about all familial, corporate and financial relationships between the principals of D B Pace and Titan Atlas.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"298\" data-total-count=\"2460\">In the letter Tuesday to the Trump Organization affiliate, South Carolina officials said that D B Pace had decided not to provide the required information.

Ms. Hussein and her sister played softball when they were young, but in middle school they stopped, as did many of their Muslim peers. \u201cIt was not normal to see girls playing sports,\u201d she said of her childhood.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"229\" data-total-count=\"560\">\u201cYou\u2019d see boys continuing to play and getting support by the parents,\u201d said Ms. Hussein, now 29 and a social worker. \u201cIt\u2019s not that my dad ever said, \u2018You can\u2019t play,\u2019 but we just never got that encouragement.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"490\" data-total-count=\"1050\">Another impediment was that Ms. Hussein and her sister wore hijabs, the scarves that many Muslim women and girls use to cover their heads, ears and necks. The garments are typically made of thick fabric that wraps around the neck; some hijabs require pins as fasteners. On the playing field, hijabs are prone to unraveling, and they can be hot and unwieldy. Sometimes they\u2019re even dangerous \u2014 other players could trip on them if they unravel, or the pins could jab the wearer or others.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"157\" data-total-count=\"1207\">During her childhood Ms. Hussein said she was preoccupied by thoughts of \u201cthis doesn\u2019t look right, this is falling, I don\u2019t feel comfortable inside.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"1471\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Eight years ago, she realized that the young girls she worked with at a Minneapolis community center shared those feelings, so she founded the <a href=\"http://www.girlswinmn.com/\">Girls Initiative in Recreation and Leisurely Sports</a>, or Girls, a program that provides girls-only gym time at the center.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"1623\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Next she decided to tackle the hijab issue. A year ago, she and a business partner started <a href=\"http://www.asiyasport.com/\">Asiya</a>, a company that sells head scarves designed for sports.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"254\" data-total-count=\"1877\">The Asiya hijabs are made of a lightweight, sweat-wicking fabric, and they come in three styles with varying degrees of coverage. They don\u2019t require wrapping or pins because they\u2019re snug-fitting with built-in headbands that further secure the fabric.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"361\" data-total-count=\"2238\">For Ms. Hussein, who works full-time as a social worker and had no business background, the transition into entrepreneurship presented a steep learning curve. A small corps of businesswomen in Minneapolis, along with a state senator, swooped in to help bring her product to market. Asiya\u2019s story shows how mentors can be integral to a new business\u2019s growth.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"535\" data-total-count=\"2773\">A year and a half ago, an early design of what would become the Asiya hijab caught the eye of Minnesota State Senator Kari Dziedzic during a fashion show. She recognized a potential benefit to the state\u2019s Muslim girls and to the economy, in terms of job creation, so she volunteered to help connect Ms. Hussein with local entrepreneurs. One of them was Monica Nassif, the founder of the Caldrea Company and Mrs. Meyer\u2019s Clean Day, both of which make aromatic cleaning products. Ms. Nassif said she was drawn to the idea right away.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"81\" data-total-count=\"2854\">\u201cI grew up in a family of athletes, and I knew the power of sport,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"208\" data-total-count=\"3062\">Ms. Nassif began advising Ms. Hussein on a volunteer basis, as did a couple of other businesswomen. \u201cWhat are you good at? What do you have time for?\u201d were her initial questions for Ms. Hussein, she said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"243\" data-total-count=\"3305\">The two biggest challenges to Ms. Hussein\u2019s success, as Ms. Nassif saw it, were time and money constraints. She felt strongly that Asiya needed to be the first to market in the United States, which would require the company to raise capital.</p>", "<p class=\"summary\"></p>", "<p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>", "<p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

It\u2019s really important to be one of the leaders.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"289\" data-total-count=\"3810\">Getting any product to market quickly requires focus, and often entrepreneurs get in their own way. \u201cI call it falling in love with yourself,\u201d Ms. Nassif said. \u201cA lot of people get so enraptured with their idea that they can\u2019t actually put their head down and get the work done.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"472\" data-total-count=\"4282\">While Ms. Hussein understood the product, she would need a partner who could help figure out how to sell it. By putting out feelers at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, Ms. Nassif found an M.B.A. student named Jamie Glover who was interested in teaming up with Ms. Hussein. Ms. Glover had spent a decade working in marketing, at 3M and at a local advertising agency. She had also played on her college\u2019s varsity softball and volleyball teams.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"189\" data-total-count=\"4471\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Once she agreed to join forces with Ms. Hussein, they officially started Asiya. The company researched fabrics and had the participants in Ms. Hussein\u2019s Girls gym program test prototypes.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"256\" data-total-count=\"4727\">\u201cNot only did it need to be a sweat-wicking, breathable performance fabric, but because it\u2019s on your face and neck, it had to be very lightweight, soft and stretchy,\u201d Ms. Glover said, adding that they were determined to find an American manufacturer.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"361\" data-total-count=\"5088\">In order to raise money and do yet more networking, the Asiya founders entered their business plan last year in a start-up competition called the Minnesota Cup, which attracted more than 1,500 participants. Asiya won the social entrepreneurship category and was chosen as the top woman-led and minority-led business \u2014 honors that pulled in $65,000 in capital.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"495\" data-total-count=\"5583\">Last fall, Asiya raised an additional $38,000 through a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1913748268/asiyatm-activewear-designed-to-enable-muslim-athle\">Kickstarter campaign</a>. In February it plans to begin delivering hijabs to its 859 Kickstarter backers. The hijabs were priced at $25 apiece on Kickstarter, but Ms. Hussein and Ms. Glover have yet to set a permanent price. They will sell the hijabs, which are manufactured in Brainerd, Minn., on the Asiya website starting Feb. 1. They also hope to sell them at sporting goods stores and through retailers that specialize in modest clothing.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"203\" data-total-count=\"5786\">Next year, they plan to expand the business to include swimwear and active wear, and they will market the brand not just to Muslims, but also more broadly to girls and women interested in modest apparel.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"290\" data-total-count=\"6076\">Asiya will be competing with several small international businesses, including <a href=\"https://ahiida.com/\">Ahiida</a>, credited with creating the \u201cburkini\u201d bathing suit; the Dutch company <a href=\"https://www.capsters.com/\">Capsters</a>, which has been making sports hijabs since 2001; and <a href=\"http://www.friniggi.com/\">Friniggi</a>, a Botswana-based seller of hijabs and modest sportswear. .</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"420\" data-total-count=\"6496\">Ms. Hussein and Ms. Glover have also worked to gain official approval for girls to wear their hijabs in Minnesota schools\u2019 sports competitions. A few months ago, the Asiya designs were deemed to be in compliance with safety and design standards for sports uniforms, hastening Ms. Hussein and Ms. Glover\u2019s goal: a time when \u201cwe just let girls compete,\u201d Ms. Glover said, \u201cregardless of what they want to wear.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2017, on Page BU5 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: Putting Faith in a New Uniform. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/prototype\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Putting Faith and Sports on the Same Team - The New York Times</title>"]},

And unless specific reasons are stated in the agreement allowing the lessee to end the lease, the signer must make the payments, whether one can drive or not.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"132\" data-total-count=\"1287\" id=\"story-continues-3\">After her diagnosis, Ms. Mangel was in the hospital for three weeks and out of work for a total of five, and running short of money.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"154\" data-total-count=\"1441\">\u201cI was a mess,\u201d Ms. Mangel recalled. \u201cI was going through all these things and Ford would not budge.

But the terms can be severe.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"2250\">Ms. Mangel could have returned the vehicle to the dealer, and then paid the difference between the amount owed on her payments and the value of the car if sold at auction. In her case, that would have been an unbearable burden: about $15,000.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"195\" data-total-count=\"2445\">Or she could have tried to sell her lease to a third party through a lease-swapping company. But with membership and lease transfer fees, that would have also cost her more than she could afford.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"112\" data-total-count=\"2557\">\u201cA friend tried to do that,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cand he received no interest after it being listed for weeks.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"211\" data-total-count=\"2768\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Some lessors may demand payment of all the remaining payments, plus penalties. If the lessee decides simply to walk away from the lease and have the vehicle repossessed, the person\u2019s credit rating will suffer.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"172\" data-total-count=\"2940\">Leasing a vehicle, of course, is not the same as purchasing one. Rather, it\u2019s more akin to renting an apartment; as with any rental, one never actually owns the property.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"3204\">Under a vehicle lease, the lessee agrees to make payments for a fixed number of years. Those payments equal the difference between the agreed-upon value of the car when first leased and its predicted residual wholesale value at the end of the lease, plus interest.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"321\" data-total-count=\"3525\">Because the entire value of the car is not being financed, the payments are less on a monthly basis than they would be if the vehicle were purchased over the same period. That is a main reason that leasing is so popular: It lets consumers drive cars that are more expensive than those they might be able to afford to buy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"332\" data-total-count=\"3857\">When the vehicle is returned at the end of the lease, the only additional costs are those incurred if the vehicle was driven more than the maximum agreed-upon mileage, any amount due for damage beyond normal wear and tear, and any turn-in fees. The lessee may also decide to purchase the vehicle, for that contracted residual value.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"451\" data-total-count=\"4308\">One reason car leases tend to be so inflexible is that the deal is a three-party contract: The dealer signs the lease with the customer, and then assigns the contract to a leasing company. Leases can be voided if the original agreement was made under untruthful conditions \u2014 if the lessee is a minor, for example, or does not possess a valid driver\u2019s license. In those cases, the leasing company would not want to be part of a fraudulent contract.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"194\" data-total-count=\"4502\">\u201cThis is not as rare as one would think \u2014 people do fraudulent deals all the time,\u201d said Randall McCathren, managing director of the Association of Consumer Vehicle Lessors, a trade group.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"193\" data-total-count=\"4695\">In addition, if the lease terms or the vehicle was misrepresented, the lessee can try to void the lease under each state\u2019s laws on unfair and deceptive acts and practices, Mr. McCathren said.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"226\" data-total-count=\"4921\" id=\"story-continues-5\">But in a legally struck deal, even death will not necessarily free one from a lease obligation. Typically, the dead person\u2019s estate becomes liable for the obligation, although some car finance companies will make exceptions.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"49\" data-total-count=\"4970\">Still, it never hurts to try to seek concessions.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"5204\">\u201cIt absolutely pays to contact the leaseholder and try to work out some consideration,\u201d Mr. McCathren said. He noted that leasing companies will typically defer payments if a lessee is in the hospital for a limited period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"336\" data-total-count=\"5540\">Only one action will guarantee that someone is able to break any company\u2019s vehicle lease. Under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a person who has enlisted in the armed services and is to be assigned to a location outside the continental United States for more than six months can terminate a vehicle lease without penalty.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"134\" data-total-count=\"5674\">But for those who are not joining the military, the best bet for getting out of a vehicle lease is to try to sell it to a third party.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"123\" data-total-count=\"5797\">Companies like <a href=\"http://Leasetrader.com\" target=\"_blank\">Leasetrader.com</a> and <a href=\"http://Swapalease.com\" target=\"_blank\">Swapalease.com</a> act as brokers, and for a fee will try to match lease sellers and buyers.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"283\" data-total-count=\"6080\">But the manufacturers of some vehicles, including Land Rovers leased through Land Rover Financial Group, and Volvos leased through Volvo Car Financial Services, do not allow transfer of leases. Swapalease maintains a list of <a href=\"http://www.swapalease.com/help/lease-company.aspx\">vehicle manufacturers\u2019 leasing policies </a> on its website.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"390\" data-total-count=\"6470\">Some leasing companies, including Ford Motor Credit and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, will allow a lease obligation to be forgiven upon the death of the lessee. Under Mercedes\u2019s Customer Bereavement Program, when the company learns of the death of a lessee, it sends a condolence letter to the family, as well as a leather journal and pen to help it manage the estate\u2019s obligations.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"245\" data-total-count=\"6715\">If the Mercedes lease account is current, the family can choose to return the vehicle within 10 days and owe nothing further. If the family decides to keep leasing the vehicle and the new lessee meets credit criteria, no transfer fee is charged.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"7027\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Ford Motor Credit\u2019s Peace of Mind program allows the family of a deceased lessee, with a death certificate, to return the vehicle within 60 days of the death, and the lease obligation will be excused.

We felt this was a good way to help our children along.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"227\" data-total-count=\"2354\">With a traditional I.R.A., the assets can be directed through beneficiary designation forms, which will split the funds among the heirs.

And each account can have different guidelines on when and for what distributions are made.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"220\" data-total-count=\"2787\">\u201cIt\u2019s that spot where retirement planning meets <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/planning/estate-planning/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about estate planning.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">estate planning</a>,\u201d said Steven D. Brett, president of Marcum Financial Services. \u201cYou get to combine the tax advantages of an I.R.A. with the benefits of a trust.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"307\" data-total-count=\"3094\" id=\"story-continues-4\">A trusteed I.R.A. also offers asset protection. Edwin Morrow, national wealth specialist at Key Private Bank, noted that the Supreme Court, in a 2014 decision, Clark v. Rameker, ruled unanimously that funds held in traditional I.R.A.s that are inherited do not have the same protection as retirement assets.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"207\" data-total-count=\"3301\">That ruling, Mr. Morrow said, increased interest in trusteed I.R.A.s as a way for people to protect their assets when their children inherit them, and to dictate how distributions above the minimum are made.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"176\" data-total-count=\"3477\">There is the option, of course, of establishing a trust and putting the I.R.A. into it. That certainly works, but it is generally more expensive and can be messy with an I.R.A.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"228\" data-total-count=\"3705\">\u201cThere are rules that could impact your ability to stretch distributions, how you calculate those distributions and when you can get access to the funds,\u201d said Mark Newcomb, national fiduciary I.R.A. executive at U.S. Trust.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"217\" data-total-count=\"3922\">A trust can also be more than someone needs if the I.R.A. is the largest asset. A trusteed I.R.A. \u201cdoes the same thing as a trust, but it does it a little more simply, a little more effectively,\u201d Mr. Newcomb said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"272\" data-total-count=\"4194\">The separate accounts that can be created with a trusteed I.R.A. allow the amount of the required minimum distribution to be calculated based on each individual\u2019s age. When a traditional I.R.A. is inherited, the rate of distribution is set by the age of the oldest heir.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"326\" data-total-count=\"4520\">So, for example, if the heir was in her late 80s with a life expectancy of seven years, the distributions would be far larger \u2014 and incur income tax more quickly \u2014 than if the heir was 50 with a life expectancy of 35 years. If there were multiple heirs, they would all receive distributions based on the oldest among them.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"405\" data-total-count=\"4925\">The trusteed I.R.A.s allow the ages to be calculated in each separate account. If the people named to each account are, for example, 50, 60 and 70 when they inherit assets through a trusteed I.R.A., their required minimum distributions will be stretched out according to their life expectancies. In doing so, the younger beneficiaries could see the assets grow and pay the taxes on the I.R.A. more slowly.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"295\" data-total-count=\"5220\" id=\"story-continues-5\">A trusteed I.R.A. is also a way for someone to support a second spouse but ensure that whatever is left over gets directed to children from a first marriage. Otherwise, a spouse who inherits an I.R.A. could combine it with other I.R.A.s and leave it to whomever he or she wanted, Mr. Brett said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"403\" data-total-count=\"5623\">There is also a benefit if the I.R.A. owner becomes incapacitated. The trusteed I.R.A. has a provision that allows the corporate trustee to request the required minimum distribution on someone\u2019s behalf. Without that provision, if the owner had not requested that distribution, even though he was incapacitated, he could incur a substantial penalty \u2014 50 percent of the distribution, Mr. Newcomb said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"171\" data-total-count=\"5794\">One service offered by U.S. Trust, he said, pays the bills each month for the owners of trusteed I.R.A.s. That is a way to use the owners\u2019 required minimum distribution.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"42\" data-total-count=\"5836\">Still, trusteed I.R.A.s have their limits.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"244\" data-total-count=\"6080\">For one, they are expensive compared with a traditional I.R.A. that owns passively managed investments. And someone with a smaller I.R.A. may not have enough assets to justify the management fees \u2014 if a provider would even agree to manage it.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"284\" data-total-count=\"6364\">Typically, the half dozen or so providers of trusteed I.R.A.s set up and manage the accounts for the same 1 to 2 percent fee they charge to manage the assets. But given that fee, advisers say trusteed I.R.A.s typically work best for retirement accounts of $500,000, if not $1 million.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"127\" data-total-count=\"6491\">Mr. Newcomb of U.S. Trust said the bank likes to see someone have at least $250,000 in an I.R.A. and no plans to spend it down.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"214\" data-total-count=\"6705\">Manning &amp; Napier set its minimum at $1.5 million. Mr. Vosburgh said the minimum was partly to account for how that I.R.A. would probably be split into several separate accounts, which would each need to be managed.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"194\" data-total-count=\"6899\">Mr. Brett said given the amount of planning involved, people should look at this only if they have an I.R.A. that they won\u2019t spend in their lifetime and can see their heirs using it for years.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"149\" data-total-count=\"7048\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Someone setting up a trusteed I.R.A. also probably needs to consult a lawyer to create and understand the document that will guide the distributions.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"308\" data-total-count=\"7356\">And a trustee of one of these I.R.A.s is not permitted to withhold payments, unlike a regular trust. Because of federal laws governing I.R.A.s, a trustee needs to pay out the minimum required distribution each year. That can be problematic if a beneficiary is a minor or is not capable of handling the money.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"7508\">Still, apart from the required distributions, the bulk of the money does remain protected from creditors, including spouses seeking assets in a divorce.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"288\" data-total-count=\"7796\">People who are leaving their I.R.As to their spouses \u2014 or simply don\u2019t care how their money is spent after they\u2019re gone \u2014 probably have no use for a trusteed I.R.A. They could save themselves time and money by using simple beneficiary designation forms to determine who gets what.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"141\" data-total-count=\"7937\">But for a subset of affluent investors, a trusteed I.R.A. could accomplish many goals without the time and expense required to draft a trust.</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on November 19, 2016, on Page B3 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: When Retirement Savings Aren\u2019t Needed in Retirement. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/wealth-matters\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>How to Give an I.R.A. to Children Without Giving Up Control - The New York Times</title>"]},

SAGE recently announced it planned to open buildings in Brooklyn and the Bronx by the summer of 2019; similar projects are either under development or open in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia and Minneapolis. But these projects account for just over 500 housing units.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"7056\">\u201cThe reality is that the vast majority of L.G.B.T. older people will find housing in the same places others do,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the work to improve the environment in mainstream housing projects is so important.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"265\" data-total-count=\"7321\">HUD has taken steps to address the problem. In 2012, the agency issued rules prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity by housing providers that receive HUD funding or have loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"371\" data-total-count=\"7692\">This September, HUD detailed standards for evaluating claims of harassment under the Fair Housing Act, whether in administrative proceedings or in court.

Passion investing is purer \u2014 if not puritanical. And seeing how people who embrace it deploy their strategies shows just how hard it is to follow a passion in investing without some level of compromise.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"179\" data-total-count=\"1241\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Its better-known cousin, impact investing, tends to attract people who are pragmatic.

But a certain type of impact investor might look for the oil and gas company that has improved its business practices the most or is as environmentally responsible and progressive as such a company can be.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"167\" data-total-count=\"1808\">Instead of swearing off whole sectors, this type of impact investor is looking to make a practical accommodation between today\u2019s reality and tomorrow\u2019s aspiration.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"223\" data-total-count=\"2031\">Passion investors spurn such accommodations. They are driven by a belief in the primacy of a cause \u2014 animal rights, climate change, reducing waste \u2014 and try to apply that desire to all investment types. It\u2019s not easy.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"350\" data-total-count=\"2381\">\u201cI have a conversation about this quite often,\u201d said Mark Doman, chief executive of the Doman Group, an <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/planning/financial-planners/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about financial planners.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">investment adviser</a>. \u201cClients talk about how their ethics and morality guide their portfolio.

She has taken to analyzing individual securities through the lens of pollution. This has led to tough choices.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"325\" data-total-count=\"3113\">She had been earning solid returns investing in Amazon when she began to be concerned about the company\u2019s relationship with its vendors and how those vendors sold and packaged products. Was Amazon monitoring how they did business? How concerned were Amazon and its vendors with reducing the waste caused by their packaging?</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"364\" data-total-count=\"3477\" id=\"story-continues-4\">These questions prompted her to sell her stake in Amazon and buy stock in Nike, whose practices she also scrutinized. To her way of thinking, \u201cNike is much more responsible with its suppliers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re very transparent. They\u2019re dropping factories that aren\u2019t compliant. They have a huge <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160511005885/en/NIKE-Sets-Bold-Vision-Targets-2020\">new set of standards</a> they\u2019ll comply with by 2020.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"195\" data-total-count=\"3672\">When people make private investments guided by passion, the risk can seem higher. Losing all of your money in any private investment is always a possibility, particularly in early-stage ventures.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"226\" data-total-count=\"3898\">But when people assess a private investment primarily on their perception of its underlying merit, it also narrows their options. Their passion, in effect, has limited what may already be a small field of suitable investments.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"313\" data-total-count=\"4211\">Hewson Baltzell, who made his money founding a research firm called <a href=\"http://www.innovestinc.com/\">Innovest,</a> which rates publicly traded stocks, bonds, mutual funds and <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/mutual-funds-and-etfs/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">exchange-traded funds</a> on environmental, social and governance criteria, takes a fatalistic approach to his private investments, which are guided by his passion to avoid waste.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"82\" data-total-count=\"4293\">\u201cI have to be willing for the money to go down the drain completely,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"236\" data-total-count=\"4529\">It has happened once, with an investment in a food technology company. \u201cIt was a good idea, basically trying to create a more automated supply chain for small farms and organic farms,\u201d Mr. Baltzell said. \u201cThat did not work out.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"268\" data-total-count=\"4797\">His investments now include <a href=\"http://www.fiveacrefarms.com/\">Five Acre Farms</a>, an organic farm based in New York that is trying to be a lower-cost version of Horizon Organic, the dairy; and <a href=\"http://www.helios-eex.com\">Helios</a>, a British company that aims to reduce carbon emissions by modernizing the lighting systems in buildings.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"345\" data-total-count=\"5142\">However difficult investing with a pure vision may be, it also comes at the risk of hypocrisy. Mr. Doman has clients passionate about avoiding investments in fossil fuels who have duly refused to put money into oil and gas companies. But one of those clients was comfortable owning stocks in airlines, which, of course, need fossil fuels to fly.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"386\" data-total-count=\"5528\">\u201cWe talked it through and they said: \u2018Aviation and air travel are an essential part of the economy, and it\u2019s something I use \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity. I guess I can\u2019t go that far,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doman said of the client. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to own BP, Royal Dutch Shell or Mobil, but they\u2019d own American Airlines or Delta. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a very subjective assessment.\u201d</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"98\" data-total-count=\"5626\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Some investors have put parameters in place to stay focused on their passions but not to go broke.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"365\" data-total-count=\"5991\">A strategy that loses money for years, like Mr. Holehouse\u2019s focus on renewables, is not one any professional investor could sustain and still be in business. But he said he and his wife did not need their investments to live. And being tied to the jewelry business, he said, has allowed them to invest in gems and rare metals that regular investors cannot access.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"153\" data-total-count=\"6144\">\u201cKashmir sapphires have gone up 500 percent in the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, it gives us more room to let our conscience drive things.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"291\" data-total-count=\"6435\">Similarly, Mr. Baltzell\u2019s approach in choosing his angel investments is, by his own admission, one of convenience: He looks at deals that come to him and meet his criteria of reducing waste. (Professional angel investors most likely look at 10 or 20 deals before investing in one or none.)</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"148\" data-total-count=\"6583\">But he limits his angel investments to 20 percent of his net worth. Even if they\u2019re successful, he reasons, they could take years to pay him back.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"131\" data-total-count=\"6714\">\u201cIf I went totally with my heart, I\u2019d be doing this all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have trouble paying the school bills.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"85\" data-total-count=\"6799\">Affluent investors can take a chance others wouldn\u2019t. The question is, Should they?</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"227\" data-total-count=\"7026\">Preston McSwain, managing partner of Fiduciary Wealth Partners in Boston, said being deeply interested in your investment decisions was generally a good thing but focusing almost myopically on a passion could have its downside.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"185\" data-total-count=\"7211\">\u201cIf you have a very long time horizon it\u2019s certainly something you should spend time on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you need to be broadly diversified based on your goals and objectives.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"187\" data-total-count=\"7398\">He said a simple weighing of pros and cons could help even the most passionate investor gain perspective. The pros with a passion are clear \u2014 this is something the investor believes in.</p>", "<p>Advertisement</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"283\" data-total-count=\"7681\" id=\"story-continues-6\">\u201cThe cons could be extreme concentration \u2014 that can help you reach your goals really fast or it gets blown up,\u201d Mr. McSwain said. \u201cAdvisers should try to get people to think why is this important and make sure they don\u2019t get overconcentrated in too much of a good thing.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"252\" data-total-count=\"7933\">Ms. Pinkwater is one who stepped back. She wanted to invest in Chinese internet companies, thinking this would be a market that would grow steadily. She bought stock in Tencent, the Chinese internet company that owns popular messaging apps like WeChat.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"332\" data-total-count=\"8265\">But she ended up selling the stock because of Tencent\u2019s growing carbon footprint. She replaced it with Alphabet, the holding company for Google, YouTube and other technology companies. Google is well known for working to lower its carbon emissions, but is also known for getting out of China in 2010 and only now trying to return.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"131\" data-total-count=\"8396\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me the same exposure to China,\u201d Ms. Pinkwater said. \u201cI tried. I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with Tencent.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"71\" data-total-count=\"8467\">That is a perfectly dispassionate way to think of a passion investment.</p>", "<p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2017, on Page B3 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">New York edition</span> with the headline: Passion, Not Profit, Guides a Rare Subset of Investors. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Reprints</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span>  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today's Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>", "<p class=\"feedback-message\">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/wealth-matters\">See More \u00bb</a></p>", "<p class=\"user-action\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">Go to Home Page \u00bb</a></p>"], "date": "2017-02-14", "title": ["<title>Profits?
